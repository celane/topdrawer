UGS 2.10d is a port of SLAC's Unified Graphics System to Unix.
The source of this code is the SLAC VMS version of UGS.

This library has been ported strictly for use with Topdrawer.
Any other use may fail, and is not supported.

UGS has been built with these operating system releases:
    IRIX    4.0.5
    IRIX    5.1.1.1
    AIX     3.2
    ULTRIX  4.4
    SunOS   4.1.3 

Postscript, Xwindow and Tek4010  drivers have been ported initially,
as these are the most useful for current UNIX Topdrawer users.

Please report bugs, problems, and suggestions to  kreymer@fnal.gov .
