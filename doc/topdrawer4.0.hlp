1 TOPDRAWER
 [1mTOPDRAWER[0m
 [4mBonner Lab Version 4.0[0m

 This is a program primarily designed to produce graphs of scientific data.
 It also has some calculation ability.  You may create, modify, fit, combine,
 and smooth data sets.  The results may be displayed in a variety of formats.
 In the documentation your response is [4munderlined[0m and optional syntax is
 enclosed inside square brakets [].  
2 setup
 To use Topdrawer it may be necessary to set it up.  To do this:  
      $ SETUP TOPDRAWER 
 If you wish to use the previous old version:  
      $ SETUP TOPDRAWER.OLD 
 If you wish to use the version currently being tested:  
      $ SETUP TOPDRAWER.TEST 
2 introduction
 TOPDRAWER is fairly easy to use if you confine yourself to simple plots.
 First invoke TOPDRAWER by typing:  
      $ [4mTOPDRAWER[0m 
 You are then prompted:  
      TD:  You first enter your data as a set of X,Y,DX,DY values.  The
 DX,DY may be omitted if no error bars are needed.  Each data point is
 specified on a separate line.  For example a line going from 0,0 to 1,1 is
 specified as:  
      TD:[4m0,0[0m 
      TD:[4m1,1[0m 
 Then the data may be plotted as a set of points with error bars (if DX,DY
 are not zero) by typing the command:  
      TD:[4mPLOT[0m 

 If you wish to produce a histogram use the command:  
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM[0m 
 On the other hand if you wish to plot a smooth curve type:  
      TD:[4mJOIN[0m 
 For series of straight lines connecting the points:  
      TD:[4mJOIN 1 (1 segment per interval)[0m 
 To put a title at the top:  
      TD:[4mTITLE TOP 'This is my title'[0m 
 To put a title at the bottom:  
      TD:[4mTITLE BOTTOM 'This is the X axis'[0m 
 To put a title on the left:  
      TD:[4mTITLE LEFT 'This is the Y axis'[0m 

 If you are done, you then type:  
      TD:[4mEXIT[0m 

 Now you liked the plot, but you wish to change a few things.  The commands
 you typed are in file TD.TDJ.  You may edit this file to correct any
 mistakes you made.  You also should rename it:  
      $ [4mRENAME TD.TDJ MYPLOT.TOP[0m 
 and invoke TOPDRAWER again.  Now instead of typing all the commands in,
 just type:  
      $ [4mSET FILE IN 'MYPLOT'[0m 
 TOPDRAWER will re-execute the commands in the file.  Now you wish to get
 the plots out on the Talaris printer.  so you type:  
      TD:[4mSET DEVICE EXCL[0m 
 Then replot the data by typing:  
      TD:[4mSET FILE IN 'MYPLOT'[0m 
 Finally type:  
      TD:[4mEXIT[0m 

 Now the plot is printed on the Talaris by:  
      $ [4mPRINT UGDEVICE.DAT[0m 

 More plots may be added to the first plot by entering more data, and then
 either PLOT, HISTOGRAM, or JOIN.  Each command may be modified by extra
 commands to make the plot more pleasing.  For example if you type:  
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM DOTS RED[0m 
 Then the histogram will be formed with red dotted lines.  This is useful to
 differentiate it from other previously plotted histograms.  
2 philosophy
 TOPDRAWER is designed to plot and manipulate data.  It assumes that data
 consists of X vs Y with errors DX, DY.  It may be X,Y vs Z with errors
 DX,DY,DZ.  The data may be a histogram in which case DX would be the bin
 width, or it may be a set of discrete points with unrelated errors.  You
 may plot the data accordingly.  

 The basic plotting operations are:  
      1.  PLOT plots the data with optional error bars.  
      2.  JOIN joins the data points with line segments.  
      3.  HISTOGRAM plot the data as a histogram.  
      4.  BAR plots the data as a bar chart (similar to a histogram) 

2 operation
 The following command invokes TOPDRAWER:  
      $ [4mTOPDRAWER [filename] [device] [/options][0m 
 If the filename is omitted you are prompted with 
      TD:  

 You then start typing in commands to TOPDRAWER.  

 If you start TOPDRAWER from a batch stream, the commands follow the
 $ TOPDRAWER command.  
3 filename
      TD:[4mSET FILE INPUT filename[0m 

 If the optional filename is specified after TOPDRAWER, the commands are
 read from the specified file and both the journal and list file are not
 produced.  
3 options
      1.  /[NO]COMMAND[=file] - Specifies a file to get commands for
          TOPDRAWER setup.  
          (Default:TDINIT.TOP) 
      2.  /[NO]JOURNAL[=file] - Specifies a file to journal all
          interactive commands.  
          (Default:TD.TDJ) 
      3.  /[NO]LIST[=file] - Specifies a file to list the commands and
          error messages.  
          (Default:TD.LIS) 
2 devices
 Normally TD sets the output device according to the logical name PLOT_TERM
 or if it is not defined PLOT_DEVICE.  If neither is defined the device is
 assumed to be a Tektronix 4010.

2 input
 Normally  TOPDRAWER  gets  primary  input from either a batch file, or your
 terminal (SYS$INPUT).  You may have secondary  input  files  by  using  the
 command:  
      TD:[4mSET FILE INPUT filename[0m 

 If  you run TOPDRAWER interactively, but from an indirect command file, the
 input will be from the file that invoked TOPDRAWER.  If you  wish  to  have
 input from the terminal, you may assign TT:  to SYS$INPUT temporarily by:  
      $ [4mASSIGN /USER TT:  SYS$INPUT[0m 
      $ [4mTOPDRAWER[0m 

 You  should  not  do  this  in BATCH, as TT:  is the default output for the
 graphics.  You may get  data  from  output  files  generated  by  histogram
 packages.  For more information on this see:Command SET HISTOGRAM.  

 Some  input may be made via the cross hair cursor.  For example SHOW CURSOR
 brings up the cursor on your terminal.  Move the cursor to the location you
 desire,  and  press  any  key  except  "Return" The current location of the
 cursor will be typed and entered into the journal file as a comment.   Some
 other  commands that use the cursor are ARROW, BOX, CIRCLE, ELLIPSE, TITLE,
 SET WINDOW, and SET LIMITS.  

 The  input  string  may  not be longer than 256 characters.  If you need to
 omit columns or set up a special format for  the  commands:   SET CARD  and
 SET FORMAT.  

 For more information see:TOPDRAWER DATA.  
2 output
 TD produces the following output:  
      1.  Plot - This may be on your terminal, LPA0:, another terminal, or a
          file on disk.  The plot data format and file is  modified  by  the
          command:  
               TD:[4mSET DEVICE[0m 
          Plot  output  for a device other than your terminal is normally in
          the file UGDEVICE.DAT.  
      2.  Listing  - This lists all TD commands you used in a session.  This
          is normally TD.LIS, but the name may be changed by the command:  
               TD:[4mSET FILE OUTPUT 'newfilename'[0m 
          If you do not want a list file:  
               TD:[4mSET MODE LIST OFF[0m 
                    or...  
               TD:[4mSET FILE OUTPUT NL:[0m  
      3.  Journal  -  This file contains all commands entered interactively.
          It is normally file TD.TDJ, but the name may  be  changed  by  the
          command:  
               TD:[4mSET FILE JOURNAL 'newfilename'[0m 
          You may temporarily turn off journaling by:  
               TD:[4mSET MODE JOURNAL OFF[0m 
      4.  Errors - A temporary file TOPDRAWER_ERRORS.DAT is used to save the
          error messages for the current plot.  This file is only opened for
          interactive sessions.  
      5.  Data  -  You may use the LIST command to output data sets suitable
          for input to TOPDRAWER.  If you do not specify the output file  it
          goes to the Listing (TD.LIS).  
2 set_up
 You  may  specify  a  setup  file to initialize TOPDRAWER.  This is done by
 specifying the logical name TOPDRAWER_INIT.  TOPDRAWER_INIT should point to
 a  file  with  TOPDRAWER commands to be executed when TD first starts.  The
 default file name is TDINIT.TOP.  If  you  have  a  setup  file  then  then
 journal  file  and listing file are suppressed.  You must start them in the
 setup file if you want them.  

                                   example
      $ ASSIGN TDHBOOK TOPDRAWER_INIT 

 The file TDHBOOK.TOP contains the commands:  
      TD:[4mSET HIST HBOOK FILE="hbook.dat"[0m 
      TD:[4mDEFINE KEY PF3 "SET HIST TITLE PREV;NEW;HIST"/TERMINATE[0m 
      TD:[4mDEFINE KEY PF4 "SET HIST TITLE NEXT;NEW;HIST"/TERMINATE[0m 
      TD:[4mSET FILE JOURNAL HISTS.TDJ[0m 

 Now  when  you start TOPDRAWER your hbook histograms are already available,
 and keypad keys are defined to easily access them.  Your  journal  file  is
 HISTS.TDJ and you have no listing file.  

 You define:  
      $ DEFINE TOPDRAWER_INIT SYS$LOGIN 
 The  file  TDINIT.TOP  in  your root default login directory is used as the
 TOPDRAWER initialization file.  
2 data
 TOPDRAWER accepts data in a variety of forms.  
3 expressions
      <expressions>
 An  expression is an arithmetic computation enclosed inside angle brakets
 "<>".  An expression uses similar syntax to FORTRAN.  The syntax  is  not
 as  rigid  as  FORTRAN  and  some  syntactical  elements  may be omitted.
 Expression evaluation is very slow, so you should use them sparingly.  
4 constants
 Certain constants are built into TOPDRAWER.  They are:  
      1.  [4mPI[0m - 3.1416...  
                                 example
      [4m<2*PI>[0m is 6.2831...  
4 functions
 Functions are expressed as:  
      [4mfunction<expression>[0m 
 The  parenthesis  around the argument of the function may be omitted if
 the argument is a number.   All  functions  may  be  abbreviated.   The
 available functions are:  
      1.  [[4mA[0mRC][4mSIN[0mE - [inverse] Sine of angle in degrees 
      2.  [[4mA[0m][4mCOS[0mINE - [inverse] Cosine of angle in degrees 
      3.  [[4mA[0m][4mTAN[0mGENT - [inverse] Tangent of angle in degrees 
      4.  [4mRAD[0mIANS - Converts degrees to radians 
      5.  [4mDEG[0mREES - Converts radians to degrees 
      6.  [4mGAM[0mMA - GAMMA function (GAMMA(n)=(n-1)!) (Cern Library) 
      7.  [4mLOG[0mARITHM - Log to the base 10 
      8.  [4mEXP[0mONENTIAL - Power of e (inverse LN) 
      9.  [4mLN[0m - Logarithm to the base e 
     10.  [4mSQ[0mRT - Square root 
     11.  [4mRAN[0mDOM  -  Random  number.   RAN(0)  produces a random number.
          RAN(n) sets the seed to n  and  starts  a  new  random  number
          sequence.  
     12.  [4mABS[0mOLUTE - Absolute value 
     13.  [4mINT[0mEGER - Integer part of a number 
     14.  [4mFRA[0mCTION - Fractional part of a number 
     15.  [4mNINT[0mEGER - Nearest integer to a number 
     16.  [4mERF[0m - Error function (Cern Library) 
     17.  [4mERFC[0m - Error function (Cern Library) 
     18.  [4mFREQ[0m - Frequency function (Cern Library) 
4 operators
      1.  + - Add 
      2.  - - Subtract 
      3.  * - Multiply 
      4.  / - Divide 
      5.  ** - Power 
 These follow the same rules of precedence as in FORTRAN.  For example: 
      1.  2*3/4 is the same as (2*3)/4 or 1.5 
      2.  2*3+4*5 is the same as (2*3)+(4*5) or 26 
      3.  2**2**3 is the same as 2**(2**3) or 256 
      4.  2**2*3 is the same as (2**2)*3 or 12 
      5.  -2**2 is the same as -(2**2) or -4 
 Missing  operators  in  the  middle  of an expression are assumed to be
 multiply "*".  <2(3)> is the same as <2*(3)>.  
4 filenames
 TOPDRAWER will accept either VMS or UNIX style file specifications.  
                                 Example
      VMS                 UNIX
      [dir.subdir]file    /dir/subdir/file
      [.subdir]file       subdir/file
      [-.subdir]file      ../subdir/file
4 examples
      [4m<LOG(V_SUM)>[0m 
 the logarithm of the SUM.  
      [4m<SINE(V_SUM)>[0m 
           or...  
      [4m<SIN(V_SUM)>[0m 
 the sine of the SUM.  
      [4m<ARCSIN(V_SUM)>[0m 
           or...  
      [4m<ASIN(V_SUM)>[0m 
 the arcsine of the SUM.  
      <4 SINE 30) 
 is the number 2.  
      <4(2+3)> 
 is the number 24.  
3 order
 Data by default is entered in the following order.  
      X Y DX DY SYMBOL 

 Where:  
 DX is the error or 1/2 bin width for X+-DX.  
 DY is the error on Y+-DY.  
 SYMBOL is the symbol to plot.  

 You  may  change the actual order that data is entered with the SET ORDER
 command.  
3 Numbers
 Data may be expressed in any legal FORTRAN format.  For example 
      1 = 1.0 = +1.0E0 
3 points
 Data  is  entered  in a series of lines one point to a line.  Each number
 may be separated by spaces, tabs, or commas",".  Numbers may also be  run
 together  without separators, provided they begin with either plus "+" or
 minus "-".  If you wish to enter several data points  on  a  single  line
 then  they  may  be separated by semicolons ";".  Instead of a number you
 may also use expressions by enclosing it inside angle brakets "<>".  

 If you omit data the last value is used.  See: Command READ POINTS.  
3 Symbols
 Symbols  are  0O  to  9O  or  any  legal UGSYS duplex character set pair.
 "NONE" indicates no symbol.  "  " or "DOT" produces a dot.  If the symbol
 is  omitted  it is assumed to be NONE and the datum is plotted by default
 as a point rather than a symbol.  This may be modified by SET SYMBOL.  If
 you wish to use the number 1 as a symbol it must be enclosed in quotes or
 apostrophes ("1").  
3 Time-Angles-Dates
 Time  may  be  entered in hours in the format hh:mm:ss.nnn.  You may also
 enter angles as dd:mm:ss.nn in degrees, minutes, seconds.  Time or  angle
 data  must  begin  with  a number.  0::1.5 is legal for 1.5 seconds after
 midnight, while ::1.5 is not legal.  

 Dates  may  be  entered  in hours as YYYY\MM\DD.  If omitted MM or DD are
 assumed to be 1.  If you wish to enter both date and time the  format  is
 YYYY\MM\DD\HH:mm:ss.ss.  See:Command SET DATE.  

 If  time is preceded by a sign, then all 3 HOURS,MINUTES, and SECONDS are
 considered negative.  If a date or date\time is preceded  by  a  sign  it
 applies only to the YYYY (Year).  Signs (+ -) may not be imbedding inside
 a date\time.  

                                 Examples
      10 (10 am) 
      10:00 (10 am) 
      15:30:25.2 (25.2 seconds past 3:30 pm) 
      0.5 (Half past midnight) 
      0:30 (Half past midnight) 
      24:30 (Half past midnight) 
      1987\12\25\12:30 (12:30 on Dec 25, 1987) 
      -1:30:00 (10:30) 
3 types
 Data  may  either  be  X,Y,Z points or mesh data.  A point consists of an
 X,Y,[Z] value with optional errors DX,DY,[DZ] Z and DZ are  optional  and
 may  not necessarily be present.  MESH data is a data set consisting of Z
 values as a function of X and Y.  A mesh is essentially a square grid  of
 data  with X,Y vs Z.  A mesh may also have optional DX, DY, and DZ values
 attached to it.  

 Data  may  be  subdivided  into  data  sets.   Each  data set is numbered
 consecutively starting with 1.  Within  each  data  set  the  points  are
 numbered from 1 to n.  To create a new data set use the DATA SET command.
 Some commands such as FIT allow automatic creation of a new data  set  if
 the option APPEND is used.  

 When  plotting  you  may specify which data set you wish to plot with the
 option SET=n.  For example PLOT SET=1 plots the first data set.  You  may
 also  use  FIRST,LAST,NEXT,PREVIOUS,  or  CURRENT  to specify a data set.
 FIRST is always set number 1 while LAST  is  the  number  of  data  sets.
 CURRENT  is  the  last  set  specified.  NEXT is the current data set +1,
 while PREVIOUS is the current set -1.  

 For example you may plot 2 sets by:  
      TD:[4mPLOT SET=FIRST[0m 
      TD:[4mPLOT SET=NEXT[0m 
 You may also specify a range of sets.  
      TD:[4mPLOT SET=2 TO LAST[0m 
 plots all data sets except for number 1.  
                                  Warning
 When  plotting  multiple  data sets, the format of the plot is taken from
 the first data set.  If the first set is a mesh, the plot will be 3-D.  
3 ON|OFF
 A number of options use ON or OFF to modify them.  For example:  
      TD:[4mSET MODE VECTOR=OFF[0m 
 Uses  hardware  characters whenever possible.  Instead of ON, OFF you may
 also use T,F or TRUE,FALSE or YES,NO.  
3 examples
 The   following  will  enter  a  series  of  data  points  in  the  order
 x,dx,y,dy,symbol.  
      TD:[4mSET ORDER X DX Y DY SYMBOL[0m 
      TD:[4m+1+.5+10+.5'0o'[0m 
      TD:[4m2 .5 25 .5 1o[0m 
      TD:[4m3 .25 10 .01 2o[0m 
      TD:[4m4 .1 5 1e-1 3o[0m 
2 Coordinate_frame
 There are 2 different sets of frames used in creating plots.  They are DATA
 and TEXT frames.  TEXT is always specified in  inches  Unless  modified  by
 either a SET SIZE or SET UNITS command.  The character and symbol sizes and
 are all specified in tenths of inches.  Both of these may be changed by the
 SET UNITS  command.   The actual data is in the DATA frame, which is mapped
 to the physical (TEXT) frame at the time of plotting.  The  plots  are  all
 scaled  automatically, unless you use the command SET LIMITS to specify the
 scale.  All commands which plot "things" work in either  the  DATA  or  the
 TEXT  frame.   You  may  select the frame with the option DATA or TEXT.  In
 addition if 3d coordinates are used the frame is automatically DATA.  

      The  DATA  frame  is  not  mapped  to  the TEXT frame until a plotting
 command or a command which uses the data frame is used.  Plotting  commands
 are JOIN, HISTOGRAM, PLOT and so on.  Commands which use the data frame are
 ARROW DATA, BOX DATA, TITLE DATA and so on.  If you wish to have  TOPDRAWER
 automatically  set  the  data  frame, you should supply the data [4mbefore[0m any
 commands which reference the data frame.  

 Several commands modify the data frame, once it has been defined:  
      SET WINDOW 
      SET LIMITS 
      SET THREE 
      SET SIZE 
      SET SCALE 
 These  commands allow you to overlay different plots with different scales.
 Just reading in new data does not change the current data frame.  
2 Fonts
 There  are  several  fonts  available  in  the unified graphics.  They are:
 EXTENDED and DUPLEX.  

 The EXTENDED and DUPLEX support many sets of characters.  The DUPLEX set is
 slow compared to the  extended  set,  but  it  looks  almost  like  printed
 characters  if  you  use a high resolution device.  The alternate character
 sets are determined by a character pair.  The  first  character  determines
 the actual character printer, the second one determines the case.

3 examples
 To draw the letter A with a bar over it.  You first draw an "A" then move
 back 1 space, then draw an Overscore.  
      TITLE "A0O" CASE " UD" 
 To draw a lowercase greek Lambda with a "hat or circumflex" over it.  
      TITLE "L012" CASE "GUV V" 
3 Setting_fonts
 The fonts are selected in 2 different ways for plot symbols and titles.  

 For  plot  symbols  you use a 2 character identifier for the symbol.  For
 example 0O selects the cross as a plot symbol.  See commands:  
      1.  SET SYMBOL 
      2.  PLOT 
      3.  SET ORDER 

 For  titles  the special symbols are selected with the CASE command.  The
 case command specifies a string with a font selection character for  each
 character  in  the  title.   For  example  you  wish  to  write  in Greek
 Alpha,Beta,Gamma followed by ABC.  
      TD:[4mTITLE "ABGABC"[0m 
      TD:[4mCASE  "GGG   "[0m 
2 3-Dimensional_plots
 TOPDRAWER  will  do  a  variety  of  3-d  plots.   You can plot a series of
 separate graphs superimposed on a third axis, or you can enter an array  of
 data  to be plotted with hidden line removal.  The array of data is entered
 by the READ MESH command.  The mesh is then plotted by the HISTOGRAM  ,JOIN
 or PLOT commands.  
      1.  HISTOGRAM BLOCK produces a block or "Lego" plot of mesh data.  
      2.  JOIN produces a mesh surface.  
      3.  SET THREE OFF;PLOT produces a scatter plot of mesh data.  
      4.  CONTOUR produces a contour plot.  

      Axes  are  not  automatically  added to 3-d graphs so you must use the
 command PLOT AXES.  You may turn each axis on separately using the SET AXIS
 command  and  then  PLOT  AXES  X,Y,Z  to  place  each axis in a convenient
 location.  

      The  command  SET  THREE  is  used to specify the "viewpoint" of a 3-d
 plot.  SET SCALE is also used to specify the range and type of scale to use
 along each of the X,Y,Z axes.  

      3-d  plots  may  also be built from a series of 2-d plots.  To do this
 you must provide z values and:  
      TD:[4mSET THREE ON[0m 
 Then  either  JOIN, HISTOGRAM or PLOT is used to plot the data.  Normally Z
 is the dependent variable, and X,Y are the independent variables.  If  this
 rule  is violated, 3-d histograms will not be correctly plotted.  Your data
 may be moved with the SWAP command if you need to get it into  the  correct
 variables.  
3 Axes_example
 Assume  you are plotting a mesh which extends x from 0 to 10, y from 0 to
 20, z from 0 to 1.  The axes will normally appear behind the  plot  which
 may  be  hard to read.  You can move the axes to the front for X,Y and to
 the right for Z with the following commands.  
      TD:[4mSET AXES ALL OFF X ON Y ON[0m 
      TD:[4mSET THREE ORIGIN 10 20 0[0m 
      TD:[4mPLOT AXES[0m 
      TD:[4mTITLE X CENTER "X title"[0m 
      TD:[4mTITLE Y CENTER "Y title"[0m 
      TD:[4mSET AXES ALL OFF Z ON[0m 
      TD:[4mSET THREE ORIGIN 0 20 0[0m 
      TD:[4mPLOT AXES[0m 
      TD:[4mTITLE Z CENTER "Z title"[0m 
2 Histograms
 TOPDRAWER can read files written by other histogram packages, and then plot
 them.  Support is provided for  the  HBOOK  histogram  package.   For  more
 information see:  
      SET HISTOGRAM 
2 COMMANDS
3 format_of_commands
 Normally  1  command is placed on a single line.  If you wish to put more
 than 1 command per line, they must be separated by a semicolon ";" 

 Optional  syntax  in a command is shown enclosed in square brackets "[]".
 If options are mutually exclusive they are separated by vertical bars "|"
 Options within a command may appear in any order.  Parameters must follow
 the option they modify.  Options in a command may be  separated  by  tabs
 spaces  * , or =.  For example SIZE=5 is the same as SIZE 5 or /SIZE=5 or
 ,SIZE 5.  

 Commands  and options may be abbreviated to the shortest number of unique
 characters or a  minimum  of  2  characters.   For  example  the  command
 BARGRAPH may be abbreviated to BARGR, BAR or even BA.  SET FILE INPUT may
 be abbreviated to SE FI  IN.   All  commands  may  be  abbreviated  to  3
 characters.  The minimum abbreviation for each option is underlined.  

 Commands  are  read from left to right.  If conflicting options are given
 for the same command,  the  right  most  option  is  used.   For  example
 SET AXES ON OFF turns the axes off.  

 Many  commands have synonyms.  For example AXES or AXIS, STOP or END, NEW
 FRAME or NEW PLOT or just NEW.  

 Comments may be added to a command by enclosing them in parentheses "()".
 If the line begins with a double slash, "//" the rest of the  line  is  a
 comment.  
3 ?
 The  question  mark  may be used after a command to get immediate help on
 the options.  TOPDRAWER  will  list  the  various  options  and  what  is
 expected  after  each option.  If the option expects more key words, they
 are not listed.

4 APPEND
 For  commands  that  transform  data either the specified data sets are
 replaced by the new data set, or all data sets are replaced by the  new
 data.   If  you wish to retain the old data the option APPEND creates a
 new data set with the transformed data.  
 (Default:OFF) 

 See:Command SET MODE 
4 CYCLE
 When  plotting  more  than  1  slice or data set, CYCLE causes the line
 texture, color, and width to vary from one plot to the next.  The order
 of  cycling  is  set  by  the SET CYCLE command.  If you have specified
 either texture, color or width it overrides the cycle value.  
 (Default:OFF) 
4 EXPAND
 Sets  the  limits so that the selected data expands to fill the window.
 This has  no  effect  unless  LIMITED,  POINTS,  SETS,  or  SLICES  are
 specified.   Normally  the  limits of the plot are set according to all
 data.  This may inconvenient  when  the  plotted  subset  of  the  data
 occupies only a small portion of the window.  EXPAND will make the data
 fill the window.  
 (Default:OFF) 

 See:Command SET MODE 
4 FILL
 Generates a fill pattern.  To set the fill pattern see:SET FILL.  
 (Default:OFF) 
4 HIDE
 Controls  whether hidden lines are drawn for a 3-d mesh, or whether one
 plot hides the next.  You must specify HIDE for both  the  plot  to  be
 hidden  and the plot that is to hide it.  The plot which is drawn first
 will hide the second one.   HIDE=OFF  draws  the  hidden  lines,  while
 HIDE=ON omits them.  
 (Default:HIDE=ON for mesh, HIDE=OFF for data) 

                                 example
 Assume  you  have  2 data sets where you want set 1 to hide elements in
 set 2.  Also you would like to fill data set 2.  
      TD:JOIN SET=1 HIDE 
      TD:JOINS SET=2 HIDE FILL 

 You  can  produce a drawing of a mesh with hidden lines as dotted lines
 by doing the histogram twice:  
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM[0m 
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM HIDE=OFF DOTTED[0m 
4 LOG
 This  logs  the operation by typing on your terminal a line telling you
 what was done.  
 (Default:OFF) 
4 NAME
 The  new  set  will  usually have a name consisting of a transformation
 name followed by the old set name.  If you specify a  new  name  it  is
 applied to the new data set.  If the name ends in "%" then the old name
 is appended to the new name.  See option:APPEND 
4 POINTS|COLUMNS
 This  selects the points or the colums of a mesh to plot or modify.  If
 not selected all points are used.  If n2 is omitted it is assumed to be
 n1.  You may specify the point number or the options FIRST,LAST.  
4 SELECT
 SELECT="name"
 selects  the  data  sets to plot or modify by name.  You may use "wild"
 characters.  "*" means any  characters,  while  "%"  means  any  single
 character.  Normally the match is case blind unless you:  
      TD:SET EXACT 
4 SETS
 This  selects  the data sets to plot or modify.  If n2 is omitted it is
 assumed to be n1.  You may specify the data set number or  the  options
 FIRST,LAST.  
4 SOLID...
 This determines the texture of the line.  By stringing together several
 texture commands you may create very complicated textures.  For example
 DOT  SPACE  DOT  DASH  will produce a dot-dot-dast pattern with a large
 space between the dots.  

      1.  SOLID  produces  a  totally  solid  line.   This overrides all
          previous specifications.  
      2.  DOT produces a dot 
      3.  DASH produces a short dash 
      4.  DAASH produces a long dash 
      5.  SPACE produces extra space between previous elements 
      6.  FUNNY produces random distances between elements 
      7.  PATTERNED  makes  the  pattern  according  to  the current SET
          pattern if it is specified by itself.  If specified with other
          options it produces the patterns by generating a pattern.  The
          length of the elements is determined by the size  in  the  SET
          PATTERN command.  
      8.  Some  combinations  will produce the patterns by hardware when
          available.  This makes for quick,  but  not  necessarily  nice
          plots.  The following generally use hardware:  
          A.  DOT 
          B.  DASH 
          C.  DOT DASH 
          D.  DAASH 

 See:Command SET TEXTURE 
4 SLICES
           [SLICES [X|Y|Z] [[4mFR[0mOM] v1 [[[4mTO[0m] v2]] [CYCLE[=ON|OFF]] 
                or...  
           [SLICE X|Y|Z=v1] [CYCLE[=ON|OFF]] 

 This  plots  or  joins  points  sliced from mesh data.  This command is
 illegal for normal data.  If v2 is omitted then v2=v1.  If a  range  is
 selected then all slices within the range are histogrammed.  IF you set
 THREE=OFF then the slices are histogrammed according to the first X,Y,Z
 Mentioned.   If  X  is first then the slices are taken perpendicular to
 the X axis.  You only need select X|Y|Z the first time you slice  after
 a NEW FRAME command.  
3 TITLE
 This takes the name of the data set you are plotting and uses it to write
 a title on the plot.  The name is  divided  into  4  parts  separated  by
 semicolons ";".  The 4 parts are placed at the TOP,X,Y,Z locations of the
 plot.  If the default title color, width  are  none  then  the  title  is
 plotted with the same color, width as the the data set.  

 This can be very helpful when overlaying several data sets, as the titles
 correspond to the data set.  
3 WHITE...
 This sets the color of the plot.

 This adds or subtracts the (Y/Z) values in data set n2 (from,to) data set
 n1.  The result is a modified set n1.  
4 APPEND
 If  APPEND is specified, then a new data set is created, containing the
 result and n1 is unchanged.  
4 AVERAGE
 This  option  will  not  work  for the SUBTRACT command.  If AVERAGE is
 specified, the data is averaged together according to the Y statistics.
 If  Y  is  non zero but DY is 0 then DY is assumed to be 1.  If both Y1
 and DY1 are zero then Y3,DY3 = Y2,DY2.  
      Y3=(Y1/DY1**2+Y2/DY2**2)/(1/DY1**2+1/DY2**2) 
      DY3=SQRT(2*DY1**2*DY2**2/(DY1**2+DY2**2)) 
 If  you  wish to average several data sets with statistics, this should
 give you the correct result.  Zero data with zero statistics  indicates
 the  absence of data.  If you wish to average several data sets without
 statistics then you should always set the statistics to a  "reasonable"
 value.  
4 CHECK
 CHECK=OFF  turns  off  data set checking.  When CHECK=ON both data sets
 must have identical X (and Y if mesh)  values,  but  data  set  n2  may
 contain  more  points than n1.  If (DX/DY) is non zero then the both DX
 and X must be identical within 1% of DX.  If you have  data  sets  with
 non  identical  values  of X you may create a set with identical values
 using the BIN command.  you may also add together data  sets  with  the
 BIN  command.   If the X values of 2 data sets are not quite identical.
 You may force TOPDRAWER to add them by setting  DX  for  the  data  100
 times greater than the difference in X or by setting CHECK=OFF.  
4 ERROR
 ERROR=OFF excludes the errors from the FIT in the computation.  
 (Default:ERROR=ON) 
4 FIT
 Specifies  that the last FIT is to be added or subtracted from the data
 set.  See:Command FIT.  
4 LIMITED
 You  may  specify the limits over which the histograms are to be added.
 If you specify the Y or Z limits, then all data  that  contains  values
 inside these limits will be added.  For example if you 
      ADD 1 to 2 LIMITED FROM Y=10 to Y=11 
 But data set 1 contains the followind data:  
 1,0;  2,10;  3,0;  4,11;  5,0 
 Points  2 to 4 inclusive will be added, and only points 1 and 5 will be
 omitted.  
4 LOG
 If  LOG  is  specified  then the result of the command is typed on your
 terminal.  
4 VECTOR
 The  DX,DY,DZ's will be added together assuming they are a vector.  The
 X,Y,Z are not changed, and they should match for both input data sets. 
4 WEIGHT-EWEIGHT
 WEIGHT=n  specifies  a  weighting factor to multiply the data by before
 adding or subtracting it.  EWEIGHT=n specifies  the  error  on  WEIGHT.
 This option must precede the data set number.  
4 X|Y
 Selects  which  coordinate  of  regular data is to be added.  Mesh data
 always adds the dependent coordinate which is usually z.  (Default:Y) 
4 notes
 For  mesh  data the independent coordinate must be Z.  For 2-d data the
 independent coordinate is always Y.  If you add  normal  data  to  mesh
 data  each  normal  Y value is added to the corresponding mesh Z value.
 You may not add mesh data to normal 2-d data.  

 If  EFFICIENCY is not specified then the new value is Y3=Y1(+-)Y2.  The
 errors  (DY)  are  treated  as  if  the  data  sets  are   uncorrelated
 DY3=SQRT(DY1**2+DY2**2).  

 The ADD command with CHECK=OFF allows you to combine X,Y,Z...  data 
      TD:[4mSWAP  X  Y  SET=1[0m  from  1  data  set with mismatched data from
 another set.  For example you wish to plot Y of set 1 vs Y of set 2.  
      TD:[4mSWAP X Y SET=1[0m 
      TD:[4mADD 1,1 APPEND[0m (Produces set 3=set 1) 
      TD:[4mY=0 SET=LAST[0m (Set 3 has only X) 
      TD:[4mADD 2,3 CHECK=OFF[0m (Set 3 has Y(1),Y(2)) 
 Set 3 now has X=Y(set 1) and Y=Y(set 2)

          is specified the end point is assumed to be specified in  data
          coordinates.   If  CURSOR  is  specified you may enter the end
          point with the cross hair cursor.  The cursor appears  on  the
          screen.   Just  move  it  to the end point and press the space
          bar.  If you press  any  other  key,  the  end  point  is  not

 This transforms data to a frequency distribution (histogram) with equally
 spaced X/Y values.  
4 introduction
 For  each  X entered, the corresponding Y is added/averaged to a bin in
 the histogram.  If all Ys are zero Y and DY  are  assumed  to  be  1.0.
 When  averaging  any  DYs  which  are  zero are assumed to be 1.0.  The
 result is an evenly spaced series of X values  with  the  corresponding
 distribution  in  Y  and  the  standard deviation of each Y in DY.  The
 symbol for each bin is set to the  default.   You  may  find  that  the
 resulting  data is not in the correct storage locations especially if a
 3-d plot is to be produced.  You may change  locations  with  the  SWAP
 command.  If the data has a non zero DX then it may be distributed over
 more than 1 bin.  The DX error distribution is assumed to be  gaussian,
 and the data is distributed with a cut off at 4 sigma.  
4 options
      1.  MESH - Bins data into a MESH 
      2.  ERRORS - Bins data into a MESH with errors if MESH is
          selected.  
      3.  X,Y - Select the axes to specify bins.  
      4.  BINS|N - The number of bins in the histogram.  
      5.  VALUES - You are specifying the bin values rather than the bin
          edge.  
      6.  FROM - Sets the lowest bin value (low edge) 
      7.  TO - Sets the highest bin value.  
      8.  BY - Sets the bin width.  
      9.  NORMAL - Selects either a normal (Gaussian) distribution or a
          flat (histogram) distribution.  
     10.  NAME - Selects the name of the appended data set 
     11.  POINTS - Specifies the range of points within a data set to
          use.  
     12.  SETS - Specifies the range of data sets to use.  
     13.  APPEND - The new data is appended to the current data as a new
          set rather than replacing it.  
     14.  AVERAGE - Produces a weighted average of the data 
     15.  LIMITED - Selects the range of data to bin.  
     16.  LOG - Types the result of the command 
     17.  MONITOR - Plots the result.  

4 AVERAGE
 A  weighted  average  is produced of the data.  The data is weighted by
 1/DY**2 if DY is non zero.  Otherwise a  weight  of  1  is  used.   The
 result  is  X,Y,DY.   If  the original DYs are all zero (or 1) then the
 final DY is 1/SQRT(points).  Where  points  is  the  number  of  points
 averaged to form a bin.  
4 APPEND
 If  APPEND=ON  the resulting data sets are appended to the current data
 sets.  If OFF then the current data is replaced by the new binned data. 
4 ERRORS
 If this option and MESH are selected, then the mesh will have errors on
 its data.

 Specifies  the  range  of  the  histogram.   If  FROM,TO  and NBINS are
 specified BY may not be specified.  FROM is the lowes bin edge.  TO  is
 the  highest  bin  edge.   BY  is the bin width, And N is the number of

 If VALUES is specified then the FROM and TO are the center of the first
 bin and the center of the last bin.  

 If these are omitted then the data is scanned and the bins are arranged
 according to the current scale values.  (See:SET SCALE) If the data  to
 bin  is  arranged  as  a set of matching histograms, the final data set
 will have the same x values as the initial.  A  histogram  has  equally
 spaced  x  values  with identical DX.  Data sets match if the initial X
 and DX values are the same.  

 The following are equivalent commands:  
      TD:[4mBIN FROM 0 TO 10 BY 1[0m 
      TD:[4mBIN FROM 0 TO 10 N=10[0m 
      TD:[4mBIN FROM 0 BY 1 N=10[0m 
      TD:[4mBIN VALUES FROM .5 TO 9.5 BY 1[0m 
4 LIMITED
 Specifies  which  data  are to be binned.  If limits are not specified,
 the default is the current plot limits.  See:Command SET LIMITS.  
      1.  X - Specifies X limit 
      2.  Y - Specifies Y limit 
      3.  Z - Specifies the Z limit 
      4.  CURSOR  -  Brings up the cursor.  You move it to the X,Y value
          you wish then press the space bar to enter both X,Y  or  X  to
          enter X or Y to enter Y.  
      5.  RECURSOR - The cursor enters both limits.  

                                 Example
      TD:[4mBIN LIMITED FROM X=1 to X=5[0m 
 Sets limits on the range of X data to bin.  
      TD:[4mBIN LIMITED FROM 1,5.5 TO 5,50.8[0m 
 Sets limits on the range of X,Y to bin.  This does not set the range of
 the final data sets.  
4 MESH
 Bins  data into a mesh of Z vs X,Y.  The Z values are added or averaged
 together.  If Z does not exist you are given an error message.   APPEND
 is ignored for a MESH.  
                                 example
      TD:[4mBIN MESH X FROM 1 to 10 by 1 Y FROM 10 to 100 by 10[0m 
4 MONITOR     
 If selected it histograms the result.  
 See:  SET MODE MONITOR 
4 NORMAL
 NORMAL=ON  selects  a  normal distribution with a cutoff at 4 sigma for
 the error DX.  NORMAL=OFF selects a flat distribution from -DX to  +DX.
 This is probably preferable for rebinning another histogram.  
 (Default:NORMAL=ON) 
4 X...
 This  specifies  which  axes  to  bin.   X  is  always binned.  If Y is
 specified then both X and Y are  binned.   After  X  or  Y  you  should
 specify  the  FROM,TO,BY  options  if  you  wish to bin into a specific
 range, or step size.  If you specify Y without MESH then a set of  data
 sets are produced, each for a different Y.  
4 VALUES
 Normally  FROM,TO specify the edges of the minimum, maximum bins.  When
 VALUES=ON then they specify the center of the bins.  
4 histograms
 You may add together 2 histograms or average together 2 histograms with
 different bin widths.  You should specify the correct  DX  and  DY  for
 each  data  set  you  wish  to  add.   You  probably  also  wish to use
 NORMAL=OFF 

 If  you do not specify FROM, TO ...  a set of values is assumed.  First
 if you are binning 2 histograms with equally spaced equivalent  values,
 then  the  same  X  values  are  assumed.  Otherwise the current X tick
 spacing is used.  
4 Example
 Say  you  wish  to  find the frequency distribution of a set of student
 grades in 5 point steps.  The following will do the job:  
      TD:[4mSET ORDER X[0m 
           (Enter grades) 
      TD:[4mGrade1;  Grade2;  Grade3.....[0m  
      TD:[4mGraden;.......[0m  
      TD:[4mBIN BY 5[0m (now do the binning) 
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM[0m 
 Suppose  you  wish  to add together 2 HBOOK histograms.  Each histogram
 contains counts, but the X spacing is different.  
      TD:[4mSET HIST HBOOK ID=n1[0m 
      TD:[4mSET HIST ID=n2 APPEND[0m 
           You now have both hists in memory.  
      TD:[4mDY=POISSON[0m (set the errors) 
      TD:[4mBIN NORMAL=OFF[0m 
 You  now  have  both histograms added together.  If both histograms had
 the same X values/bin then the result will have the same  X  values  as
 the original.  
3 BOX
 Draws a box centered on the x,y with the sides parallel to the axes.

4 AT
 x,y,z  specify  the center of the box.  If z is specified then they are
 assumed to be data units.  Instead of x,y,z you may specify CURSOR.  If
 x,y,z are specified without FROM,TO, then AT is assumed.  
4 FROM-TO
 You  may also specify the diagonally opposite corners of the box.  If z
 is specified then they are assumed to be data units.  Instead of  x,y,z
 you may specify CURSOR.  
4 FILL
 Fills in the box using the current fill pattern.  See:SET FILL 
4 CURSOR
 The  cross  hair  cursor is used to specify the limits or center of the
 box.  First move the cursor to a corner of the box.   Press  the  space
 bar.   Next  move  the  cursor the diagonally opposite corner and press
 space again to draw the box.  If you decide not to draw the box,  press
 any other key other than space or "Return".  
4 DATA
 Specifies  X,Y  are in data coordinate frame.  Normally they are in the
 TEXT coordinate frame.  This option is not necessary if z or DSIZE  are
 specified.  
4 DSIZE
 Specifies the size in data units.  If the size is in data units the x,y
 are assumed to be data units also.  
4 ROTATE
 Specifies  a  rotation  angle  in degrees.  Rotation is right handed or
 counterclockwise.  
4 SIZE
 Specifies  the  size  in inches DX is the width of the box.  If omitted
 the width is the default see:Command SET BOX SIZE.  DY is the height of
 the box.  If omitted DY=DX.  
4 SQUARE
 The  option  SQUARE  or  SYMMETRIC  produces a square box.  The SIZE is
 treated as a diagonal through the center of a square, and FROM, TO  are
 treated as the coordinates of 2 opposite sides of a square.  
4 SOLID...
 Sets the texture of the line.  See:Command SET TEXTURE.  
4 INTENSITY
 Sets the intensity (n=1-5) 
4 WHITE...
 Sets the color of the line.

4 n1...
 Contour lines are drawn for the specified values n1,n2...  

 If  no values are specified, then lines are drawn according to the tick
 locations selected by the SET SCALE command.  Primary contour lines are
 determined  by  the long tick locations, and the secondary lines by the
 short ticks.  

 If  the  scale of the Z axis is set to be logarithmic, then the primary
 lines are at powers of 10.  
4 COLOR
 Sets the color of primary contour lines.  
4 CYCLE
 CYCLE causes the line texture, color, and width attributes to vary from
 one set of secondary contour lines to the next.  The order  of  cycling
 is  set  by the SET CYCLE command.  The attributes specified by the SET
 SECONDARY command override those specified by the  SET  CYCLE  command.
 Primary  contour  lines  also vary according to cycles.  If you specify
 any attributes they are used for the primary contours, and override the
 the cycles.  
4 EXPAND
 Sets  the  limits so that the selected data expands to fill the window.
 This has no effect unless POINTS, or SETS are specified or  the  limits
 on MESH data have been set by a SET LIMITS command.  

 See:SET MODE 
4 FROM|TO|BY|N
 You  may  also  specify a range of contours with FROM,TO,BY,N.  You may
 specify any 3.  The maximum number of contours you may specify at  once
 is 100.  

                                 example
      TD:[4mCONTOUR FROM 1 TO 10 BY 2[0m 
           or...  
      TD:[4mCONTOUR FROM 1 BY 2 N=5[0m 
           or..  
      TD:[4mCONTOUR 1,3,5,7,9[0m 
 Draws contour lines at 1,3,5,7, and 9.  
4 INTENSITY
 Sets the line width or intensity of primary contour lines.  
4 LABEL
 If  LABEL=ON is specified then any contours after the LABEL option will
 be labelled.  If no  contours  are  specified  LABEL=OFF  produces  the
 default contours without any labels.  
4 OUTSIDE
 This turns on labels along the outside boundary of the contour plot for
 all contours that terminate at the boundary.  (Default) 
4 INSIDE
 This  turns  on  labels  in  the  interior  of the contour plot for all
 contours.  (Default) 
4 DOUBLE
 This turns on double labels on the outside boundary of the contour plot
 for all contours that terminate at the boundary.  This labels both ends
 of each terminal contour.  
 (Default:DOUBLE=OFF) 
4 PARALLEL
 Produces  label  which  are parallel to inside contour lines.  Normally
 labels are horizontal parallel to the X axis.  
 (Default:PARALLEL=OFF) 
4 PERPENDICULAR
 Produces  label  which  are  perpendicular  to  inside  contour  lines.
 Normally labels are horizontal parallel to the X axis.  
 (Default:PERPENDICULAR=OFF) 
4 PRIMARY|SECONDARY
 Sets  the  type  of  contour  line.   Primary  lines use the default or
 selected color, intensity, and texture.  The  secondary  contour  lines
 are determined by the SET SECONDARY command.  The default for secondary
 lines is DOTTED.  
4 SAVE
 This  saves  the  contour as a series of data sets rather than plotting
 it.  The new data sets have the name 'Contour ...' where  ...   is  the
 old data set name.  You may select the new data set with the NAME='...'
 option.  
4 SIZE
 SIZE=n  determines  the size of the contour labels in tenths of inches.
 If unspecified the size is determined by the  SET LABEL  command.   The
 color,  and  intensity  of the contour labels is also determined by the
 SET LABEL command.  
4 SOLID...
 Sets the texture of primary contour lines.  
4 example
      TD:[4mCONTOUR[0m 
 Draws a series of contour lines according to the Z scale.  

      TD:[4mCONTOUR SECONDARY 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,PRIMARY,20,LABEL,5,10[0m 
           or...  

      TD:[4mCONTOUR SECONDARY FROM 1 TO 9 BY 1 PRIMARY,20,LABEL,5,10[0m 
 Draws  contours for Z=1 to 20.  Contour 5 and 10 are labeled.  Contours
 5,10, and 20 will be SOLID, all others are dotted.  
      TD:[4mCONTOUR SAVE 10[0m 
 Saves  the  contours  for  Z=10  as  separate  data  sets.   No plot is
 produced.

3 DEFINE
 This  defines  various  things  such  as  new commands, or the keys for a
 VT-100 keypad.  
4 COMMAND
      [4mDE[0mFINE [4mCO[0mMMAND new_command "command string" 

 This defines a new command as the command string.  New commands must be
 different from existing commands, and are  only  used  if  an  existing
 command is not found.  There is a limit of 3 command substitutions in a
 row, and 1000 total substitutions per input line.   The  limit  on  the
 number of substitutions per line may be modified by SET COMMAND.  

                                 example
      [4mDEFINE COMMAND EDT "SPAWN EDT"[0m 
 Defines the command EDT so you may edit a file while using TOPDRAWER.  
      [4mDEFINE COMMAND MAIL "SPAWN MAIL"[0m 
 Defines  the  command  MAIL so you may use the mail utility while using
 TOPDRAWER.  
      [4mDEFINE COMMAND @ "SET FILE INPUT="[0m 
 Defines  @  to work similarly to @ in VMS.  @filename will get commands
 from the specified file.  
      [4mDEFINE  COMMAND  EDAT  "LIST  DATA FILE=DAT.TMP;EDT DAT.TMP;DELETE[0m
 [4mALL;  SET FILE IN=DAT.TMP"[0m 
 Defines the command EDAT to allow you to edit the current data.  
5 initialization
 You  may also define commands before running TOPDRAWER.  You make DCL
 symbols of the form:  
      TD_C_new_command :==the_command 
 When  you  type  in new_command the_command is executed.  For example
 the DCL definition:  
      $ [4mTD_C_DIR*ECTORY :=SPAWN DIRECTORY[0m 
 is the same as the TOPDRAWER command:  
      TD:[4mDEFINE COMMAND "DIR*ECTORY" "SPAWN DIR"[0m 
5 examples
 For  example  you  wish to define some DCL commands such as DIRECTORY
 for convenience.  
      TD:[4mDEFINE COMMAND DIR "SPAWN DIR"[0m 
           or...  
      TD:[4mDEFINE COMMAND "DIR*ECTORY" "SPAWN DIR"[0m 
 These  both define the command DIR.  The second definition allows any
 abbreviation from DIR to DIRECTORY to be used.  
      TD:[4mDEFINE COMMAND SC "SHOW HIST CURRENT FULL"[0m 
 Defines  the  command  SC  to show you the full status of the current
 histogram.  (See:Command SET HIST and SHOW HIST) 
      TD:[4mDEFINE COMMAND SD "SHOW DATA STATISTICS"[0m 
 Defines a command to show you the statistics of the data set.  
      TD:[4mDEFINE COMMAND SD1 "SHOW DATA STATISTICS SET=1"[0m 
 Defines  a  command to show you the statistics of the data set number
 1.  
4 HISTOGRAMS
 This   creates   HBOOK   histograms   or   modifies   the   histograms.
 See:Command SET HISTOGRAM.  You may  add  together  histograms  or  add
 ntuples  to  histograms.   The  variables  in  NTUPLES  may be added to
 several histograms all in one operation.

 [CYCLE=[ON|OFF] 
 Takes   histograms  IDENT=n1  and  n2  and  combines  them  into  the
 previously specified histograms  n3=nmin  to  nmax.   The  number  of
 channels in n1,n2, and n3 must all be the same.  
      n3=n2*f2 operation n1*f1 
 If  n1  or  n2  are  omitted  they are assumed to be n3.  If f1 or is
 omitted it is assumed to be 1.0.  If n2 is specified and n3 does  not
 exist,  it  is  created.   CYCLE  increments  N1,N2  each time.  This
 combines n1,n2 into nmin and n1+1,n2+1 into nmin+1 and so  on.   Only
 histograms  of  the same type with the same number of channels can be
 added.  

 If  n1  is  an NTUPL then it is binned into n3=nmin to nmax using the
 parameters  specified  in  previous  SET  HISTOGRAM  commands.    The
 possible options the may be set are X,DX,...,EVENTS,NLIMIT,NMASK.  If
 the target histogram does not exist it is automatically created  with
 100  channels  using the NTUPL name.  If CYCLE is selected then the X
 specification is incremented.

5 SETS       
 Creates histograms from TOPDRAWER data sets.  It selects the range of
 data sets to use in creating some histograms.  The  MESH  and  SELECT
 options  may be used to select the data set.  This allows you to take
 Topdrawer data and put it into the HBOOK structures.  The  data  used
 must  be strictly monotonic in x.  Mesh data must have equally spaced
 bins.  If you wish to store Mesh data  without  equally  spaced  bins
 then  specify  CHECK=OFF  to  turn off the bin checking.  The PROFILE
 option is ignored.  

 If you specify SETS then you may not specify X or Y ranges or ZERO.

5 STATISTICS   
 Turns on or off statistics accumulation.  This applies to HBOOK.  
5 X|Y...       
 If  you  specify  X|Y  FROM,TO  and  BY or N= then a new histogram is
 created, or an existing histogram is rescaled.  When rescaled  it  is
 recreated,  and  the  existing  scales,  and  title  are kept, if not
 respecified.  If you specify this  for  both  X  and  Y  then  a  3-d
 histrogram  is  created.   If  unspecified  FROM/TO=0 and N=100.  The
 option PROFILE creates a profile histogram using  the  specified  X,Y
 limits.  

                               examples

4 STRING
 You may define strings for "Lexicals" 
      TD:[4mDEF[0mINE [4mST[0mRING [4mname 'string'[0m 
 A lexical of the form S_name is give the string 

                                 Example
      TD:[4mDEFINE STRING NAME 'George Washington[0m 
      TD:[4mTITLE TOP 'The first president was ' S_NAME[0m 
      TD:[4mTYPE 'NAME="' S_NAME '"'[0m 

 You  may  show  all  defined strings with the SHOW STRINGS command.  An
 individual string may be examined by the TYPE command.  
      TYPE S_name 
5 Variable
 This defines a local variable of the form 
      TD_S_name 
 which  contains  the  string  that  you have defined.  You may define
 variables before entering TOPDRAWER so that they  are  available  for
 use.  You do this by:  
      $ TD_S_NAME := "String to use" 
4 VALUE
 You may define values for "Lexicals" 
      [4mDEF[0mINE [4mVA[0mLUE [4mname=value[0m [[4mLO[0mG=[[4mON[0m|[4mOF[0mF]] [[4mFA[0mST[=[4mON[0m|[4mOF[0mF]] 
 A  lexical  of  the  form V_name is give the value n If you specify LOG
 then the value is typed on your terminal.  When FAST=ON  the  value  is
 defined  as  a  local symbol in non readable form.  This will speeds up
 symbol definitions, but it has little effect on the symbol usage.   You
 should  use  FAST  when  you  are  repeatedly  redefining symbols.  Non
 readable symbols do not make sense for a SHOW VALUE  command.   If  you
 need speed, single letter names are the most efficient.  
 (Default:FAST=OFF) 

                                 Example
      TD:[4mDEFINE VALUE NORM=125.5[0m 
      TD:[4mY=Y TIMES V_NORM[0m 
 Multiplies all data by 125.5.  
      TD:[4mDEFINE VALUE NORM=<100/V_SUM>[0m 
      TD:[4mY=Y TIMES V_NORM[0m 
 Normalizes the data to SUM=100.  

 You   may   show  all  defined  values  with  the  SHOW VALUE  command.
 Individual  values  may  be  shown   by   the   SHOW LEXICAL   command.
 See:TOPDRAWER DATA 
5 Variable
 This defines a local variable of the form 
      TD_V_name

 This divides the Y values in data set n1 by data set n2.  The result is a
 modified set n1.  You may not divide normal 2-d data by mesh data.  
4 APPEND
 If  APPEND is specified, then a new data set is created, containing the
 result and n1 is unchanged.  
4 CHECK
 CHECK=OFF  turns  off  data set checking.  When CHECK=ON both data sets
 must have identical X (and Y if mesh)  values,  but  data  set  n2  may
 contain  more  points than n1.  If (DX/DY) is non zero then the both DX
 and X must be identical within 1% of DX.  If you have  data  sets  with
 non  identical  values  of X you may create a set with identical values
 using the BIN command.  If the X values of 2 data sets  are  not  quite
 identical.   You  may  force TOPDRAWER to divide them by setting DX for
 the data 100 times greater than the  difference  in  X  or  by  setting
 CHECK=OFF 
4 EFFICIENCY
 If EFFICIENCY is specified, the data is treated as an efficiency.  That
 is set n1 contains the number  of  successes,  while  n2  contains  the
 number  of  trials.   The  result  has  error  bars (DY) which follow a
 binomial distribution.  See:Command ADD,MULTIPLY.  
4 ERROR
 ERROR=OFF excludes the errors from the FIT in the computation.  
 (Default:ERROR=ON) 
4 FIT
 Specifies  that  the  data  set  is  to  be  divided  by  the last FIT.
 See:Command FIT.  
4 LIMITED
 You may specify the limits over which the histograms are to be divided.
 If you specify the Y or Z limits, then all data  that  contains  values
 inside these limits will be divided.  For example if you 
      DIVIDE 1 by 2 LIMITED FROM Y=10 to Y=11 
 But data set 1 contains the followind data:  
 1,0;  2,10;  3,0;  4,11;  5,0 
 Points  2  to 4 inclusive will be divided, and only points 1 and 5 will
 be omitted.  
4 LOG
 If  LOG  is  specified  then the result of the command is typed on your
 terminal.  
4 WEIGHT-EWEIGHT
 WEIGHT=n  specifies  a  weighting factor to multiply the data by before
 adding or subtracting it.  EWEIGHT=n specifies  the  error  on  WEIGHT.
 This option must precede the data set number.  
4 notes
 If  EFFICIENCY  is not specified then the new value is Y3=Y1/Y2.  If Y2
 is zero then Y3 is set to 0.0.  The errors (DY) are treated as  if  the
 data sets are uncorrelated, if BINOMIAL is not specified.

4 AT
 x,y,z  specify  the center of the ellipse.  If z is specified then they
 are assumed to be data units.  If x,y,z are specified without FROM, TO,
 or AT then AT is assumed.  
4 FROM-TO
 Specifies the diagonally opposite corners of box enclosing the ellipse. 
4 FILL
 Fills in the ellipse using the current fill pattern.  See:SET FILL 
4 CURSOR
 The  cross  hair  cursor  is used to specify the limits of the ellipse.
 Simply move the cross hairs so they define the lower-left limits of the
 ellipse  and  press  the  space  bar.   Next  move  the  cursor  to the
 upper-right limits of the ellipse an press space again.  If you press a
 key  other than space, the cursor information is not used.  Alternately
 you may specify the upper-left then lower-right extension, or any other
 combination that defines the ellipse.  
4 DSIZE
 specifies the size in data units.  If the size is in data units the x,y
 are assumed to be data units also.  You should note that  if  DSIZE  is
 specified, you will usually get an ellipse.  
4 ROTATE
 Specifies  a  rotation  angle  in degrees.  Rotation is right handed or
 counterclockwise.  
4 SIZE
 specifies  the size in inches DX is the width.  If omitted the width is
 the  default  See:Command SET ELLIPSE SIZE.   DY  is  the  height.   If
 omitted the DY=DX.  
4 SQUARE
 The  option SQUARE or SYMMETRIC produces a circle.  The SIZE is treated
 as the X,Y of a diameter from the center of a circle, and FROM, TO  are
 treated as the ends of diameter of the circle.  
4 DATA
 Specifies  X,Y  are in data coordinate frame.  Normally they are in the
 TEXT coordinate frame.  This option is not necessary if z or DSIZE  are
 specified.  
4 ANGLE
 The  ellipse  is  drawn  from the angle A1 to A2.  A1,A2 must be in the
 range -360 to 360 degrees.

 This  clears  the  screen  without  resetting  the buffers or the default
 values.  This is useful if you wish to view several different things with
 the  same  parameters.   If  you  specify  a  pair  of  X,Y values only a
 rectangle inside those values is cleared.  This only works  on  terminals
 that  support  selective  erase.  Each X,Y[,Z] may be specified in either
 Text or Data coordinates.  Text coordinates are assumed if  a  Z  is  not
 specified.

 This command produces a complex fast fourier transformation of the
 selected data sets.  For 2-d data the real part of the coefficients is
 stored in Y, and the imaginary part in Z if it exists.  If not then DY
 contains the imaginary part.  X contains the frequency value.  No error
 analysis is performed by this operation.  For mesh data the real part is
 stored in Z and the imaginary part in DZ.  
      1.  APPEND=ON Creates a new data set containing the result.  
      2.  CHECK=OFF Turns off the checking to see if data is a histogram. 
      3.  INVERT=ON inverts the forier series contained in Y,Z/DY.  
      4.  SETS selects the data sets to to transform.  
      5.  LOG=ON Logs the operation on your terminal.  
      6.  MONITOR If selected it histograms the original data set and the
          result.  
          See:  SET MODE MONITOR 
      7.  POLAR=ON selects polar coordinate output where Y is the
          magnitude and Z/DY is the angle in degrees.  

 The selected data must be a histogram, that is the X values must be
 equally spaced and strictly monotonic, and there must be at least 2
 points in each data set.  
4 restrictions
 The fast fourier transform is done by a modified version of the CERN
 library routine CFT.  The data is assumed to be periodic with an EVEN
 number of points.  For example, suppots you have NPT points, then we
 assume y[I]=y[I+NPT] Also, data sets are assumed to have lengths (say
 NPT) where NPT's largest prime factor is not more than 23.  The speed
 is enhanced by using small prime factors.  Thus, the routine fails for
 vector lengths

4 Interpretation
 Assuming you have periodic data, the spectrum will exhibit 2 peaks.
 The first one will be at f the frequency of the structure.  The second
 one will be at a frequency of 1/(chan width)-f.  The peak will appear
 both in the real and imaginary parts of the spectrum.

 Fits  data  and  optionally  produces  a  curve  containing the fit.  The
 coefficients are typed on the terminal and placed as comments in the  log
 file.   Data  points  with zero or negative values of DY are omitted from
 the fit.  If DY does not exist or is 0.0 for all specified data  then  DY
 is assumed to be 1.0.  If all coefficients are constrained, no fitting is
 done, but you may generate the curve for  those  coefficients.   You  may
 subtract the FIT from a data set with the SUBTRACT command.

4 AGAIN       
 Redo  the  last fit.  This option must be the first option on the line.
 After the fit command.  When you redo  the  fit  you  may  specify  new
 options  to  modify  the  fit.   If you want to set fit options without
 doing any fits use the command 
      SET FIT [options] 
 This sets fitting options to be performed by the next fit command.  The
 options on SET FIT are identical to the options on FIT.  You may use  a
 series of SET FIT commands to setup the next fit.  
4 EQUATION    
      [4mLINEAR[0m  This  allows  you  to  enter  equations for each term of a
 series to fit.  Each term is separated by a semicolon ";".  The zeroeth
 order  term  is  always  assumed  to  be  a constant so only the first,
 second...  order terms are  entered.   For  example  you  wish  to  fit
 Y=C0+C1*X**1.5+C2*EXP(X) 
      TD:FIT EQUATION "XV**1.5;EXP(XV)" 

 If you have previously fit using an equation:  
      TD:FIT EQUATION "" 
 Uses  the  same  equation  for a new fit.  All other fit options may be
 used with EQUATION, but any options that modify the number of terms  to
 fit must appear after the equation definition.  The X offset is ignored
 by the equation.  

      [4mNONLINEAR[0m If you wish to perform a fit to an arbitrary function of
 X, then you must enter the coefficients in the the equation as  COE[n],
 and  you  must  specify  the NONLINEAR option.  Remember that each term
 automatically has a coefficient, so you should use coefficients in  the
 equation  that have not been already used.  For example you wish to fit
 the equation:  
      C0+C1*/(1+C2*(X-C3)**2) 
 Recalling that C0, and C1 will already be used you enter:  
      TD:FIT EQUATION "1/(1+COE[2]*(XV-COE[3])**2)" NONLINEAR TERMS=3 
 You  may  also  need to specify initial values for the coefficients and
 inital errors for the first step.  
     CONSTRAIN=OFF COEF n0,n1,n2,n3 ERROR n0,n1,n2,n3 

 Note:   The constant term COE[0] is fit by default.  Likewise the C1 is
 automatically included as the coefficient of the first  term.   To  get
 rid of the constant term you use the option:  EXCLUDE 0 
4 POLYNOMIAL  
 Does a fit to:  
      SUM( an*(X-Offset)**n );  n=0,TERMS-1 
 This is the default if no function is specified.  
4 INVERSE     
 Does a fit to an inverse poser series:  
      Y=SUM( an*(X-Offset)**(-n) );  n=0,TERMS-1 
4 SINE        
 Does a fit to:  
      Y=a0+SUM( an*SINE((n)*(THETA-Offset)) );  n=1,TERMS-1 
4 COSINE      
 Does a fit to:  
      Y=a0+SUM( an*COS((n*(THETA-Offset)) );  n=1,TERMS-1 

 The angle THETA is normally in degrees.  If you wish to modify this see
 SET POLAR.  
4 LEGENDRE    
 Does a fit to:  
      Y=SUM  of  a legendre polynomial in (X-Offset).  ,br;If you select
 both LEGENDRE and COSINE or the data is POLAR then the Legendre  series
 is a function of COS((THETA-Offset)).  
4 EXPONENTIAL 
 Does a fit to:  
      Y=EXP( a0+a1*(x-offset)) + Polynomial when NONLINEAR=ON (Default) 
           or ...  
      LN(Y)=series(x-offset) 
 for data points with Y>0.0.  
 Where series is either POLY,SINE,COSINE or LEGENDRE.  
 If  you  wish  to  fit data which has negative or zero data points, you
 must either SMOOTH the data to get rid of them, or use the BIN  command
 to  rebin  the  data into large bins.  If all y data is less than zero,
 you may make it positive with the command:  
      TD:Y=Y TIMES -1 

 When  a  NONLINEAR  fit  is  used,  and  NTERMS=n  is  greater than 2 a
 polynomial background of n-2 terms is added to the exponential.  
4 GAUSSIAN    
 Does a fit to:  
      Y=a0*EXP(-0.5*((X-a1)/a2)**2)[+a3+a4*X+...]    for    NONLINEAR=ON
 (Default) or 
      LN(Y)=LN(a0)+-0.5*((X-a1)/a2)**2 for NONLINEAR=OFF 
      for data points with Y,DY not 0.0.  

 Since  only  data  with  both  Y,DY  nonzero are fit, there may be some
 inaccuracy for histogram data with zero in a large number of bins,  and
 small  numbers in a few bins.  Such data should be smoothed or rebinned
 to remove the bins with DY=0.  

 For  linear  fits if you specify the a0 or a1 coefficient you must also
 specify a3.  If you wish to fit data which has negative  or  zero  data
 points,  you must either SMOOTH the data to get rid of them, or use the
 BIN command to rebin the data into large bins.  If all y data  is  less
 than zero, you may make it positive with the command:  
      TD:Y=Y * -1 

 When  a  NONLINEAR  fit  is  used,  and  NTERMS=n  is  greater than 3 a
 polynomial background of n-3  terms  is  added  to  the  gaussian.   If
 NTERMS=4,5,6  a  constant, straignht line, or parabola are used for the
 background.  Larger values are possible, but not recommended.  
 For  LINEAR fits the OFFSET is used as the initial guess for the center
 of the gaussian.  When done, it is approximately equal to a1.  

 [1mWARNING[0m  If  you get the warning message that negative data points have
 beem omitted in a Gaussian fit, the fit may be incorrect.  
4 DGAUSSIAN   
 Does a fit to:  
      Z=a0*EXP(-0.5*(((X-a1)/a2)**2)+((Y-a3)/a4)**2))[+a5+a6*X+a7*Y] for
 NONLINEAR=ON (Default) or 
      for data points with Y>0.0.  

 If  you  specify  NTERMS=n  where  n  is  larger  than  5 a Dpolynomial
 background is added to the  gaussian.   The  number  of  terms  in  the
 background  is  n-5.  If NTERMS=6,8 a constant, or sloped plane is used
 for the background.  
4 DPOLYNOMAIL 
 Does a double polynomial fit to:  
      Z=a0+a1*X+a2*Y+a3*X**2+a4*X*Y+a5*Y**2+z6*X**3....  
4 USER        
      USER=n 
 Does  a  fit to a user supplied function type.  N must be between 1 and
 99 with a default of 1.  If none then a polynomial is used.   For  each
 coefficient of the linear fit the user supplied function is called:  
      Y=TDUFUN(n,NORD,X) 
 Where  n  is  the function type.  NORD is the number of the coefficient
 (1-19) and X is the x value.  The user function must return the y value
 of the term.  

 For  example  if  you want USER=1 to select a polynomial, and USER=2 to
 select  an  inverse  polynomial.   You  would   write   the   following
 subroutine:  
      FUNCTION TDUFUN(n,NORD,X)
      IF (n.eq.1) THEN
        TDUFUN=X**NORD
      IF (n.eq.2) THEN
        TDUFUN=X**(-NORD)
      ELSE
      END
4 COEFFICIENTS|ERRORS
 Sets individual coefficients|errors.  If coefficients are set then they
 are [4mnot[0m included in the calculation of the  fit  unless  CONSTRAIN=OFF.
 If  CONSTRAIN=OFF then you are merely settting the initial value of the
 coefficient.  This is only useful for nonlinear fits.  If you  set  the
 error  it  is  used as the initial step for nonlinear fits.  INDEX sets
 the index of the coefficient|error.  The index may range from 0 to  19.
 Undefined errors are assumed to be 0.0.  
                                 EXAMPLE
      TD:[4mCOEFFICIENTS 1,2.5,.5 ERRORS .1,.5,.2[0m

4 CURVE       
 Generates  the  fitted curve, (Y,DY) as a function of X, which replaces
 the current data.  DY is calculated using the error matrix.  
      1.  X                 Selects the X coordinate.  (Default) 
      2.  Y                 Selects  the  Y coordinate.  This is used to
          generate a mesh.  
      3.  APPEND - The new data is appended to the current data as a new
          set rather than replacing it.  
      4.  N - Sets the number of bins in the resulting curve.  
      5.  FROM - Sets the lowest value for the fitted curve.  
      6.  TO - Sets the highest value for the fitted curve.  
      7.  BY  -  Sets the width between data points in the fitted curve.
          You may not specify all four FROM,TO,BY, and N.  
      8.  BINS  - Specifies that FROM, TO refer to the lower edge of the
          first bin and the upper edge of the last bin.  
      9.  VALUES  -  Specifies  that FROM, TO refer to the center of the
          first and last bins.  (Default:VALUES) 

                                      Example
          The following all produce points at X=0.5,1.5,...9.5 
               CURVE VALUES FROM .5 TO 9.5 BY 1 
               CURVE BINS FROM 0 TO 10 BY 1 
               CURVE BINS FROM 0 TO BY 1 N=10 
               CURVE BINS FROM 0 TO BY 1 N=10 Y FROM 100 to 120 by 2 

 If  you do not specify FROM, TO ...  a set of values is assumed.  First
 if you are fitting a histogram with equally  spaced  values,  then  the
 same  X  values  are  assumed.  Otherwise the current X tick spacing is
 used.  
4 EXCLUDE/INCLUDE
 Selects  terms  to  include  or exclude from the fit.  n1...  may range
 from 0 to 19.  If you specify INCLUDE NONE then no terms are fit.  This
 is  useful  if you wish to generate a curve by specifying coefficients,
 without actually performing a fit.  
 (Default:EXCLUDE NONE) 
4 LIMITED     
 Fits points between the specified limits.  If limits are not specified,
 the default is the current plot  limit.   See:Command SET LIMITS.   You
 may  specify  up  to 5 sets of limits.  This allows you to fit the data
 using up to 5 regions, and omitting the rest of the data.  
      1.  X - Specifies X limit 
      2.  Y - Specifies Y limit 
      3.  Z - Specifies the Z limit 
      4.  CURSOR  -  Brings up the cursor.  You move it to the X,Y value
          you wish then press the space bar to enter both X,Y  or  X  to
          enter X or Y to enter Y.  
      5.  RECURSOR - The cursor enters all regions from the current one,
          until you type "Q".  
      6.  VLOG - Draws a cross when you press the space bar, and draws a
          dotted line around the final limits.  

                                 example
      TD:[4mFIT POLY TERMS=3 LIMITED FROM 1,1 to 2,5[0m 
           or...  
      TD:[4mFIT POLY TERMS=3 LIMITED FROM X=1 Y=1 TO X=2 Y=5[0m 
 Fits  all  points  that  with  X  between 1 and 2 and Y between 2 and 5
 inclusive.  
      TD:[4mFIT POLY TERMS=3 LIMITED FROM Y=1 TO Y=5[0m 
 Fits all data points with Y values between 1 and 5 inclusive.  
      TD:[4mFIT POLY TERMS=3 LIMITED FROM CURSOR TO CURSOR[0m 
 Fits all data points as defined by the cursor limits.  
      TD:[4mFIT POLY TERMS=3 LIMITED FROM X=CURSOR TO X=CURSOR[0m 
 Fits all data points according to X values defined by the cursor.  
 TD:[4mFIT POLY TERMS=3 LIMITED FROM 1 to 20 FROM 40 TO 80[0m 
 Fits a parabola to data in 2 regions, and skips the X values 20 to 40. 
      TD:[4mFIT POLY TERMS=3 LIMITED VLOG RECURSOR[0m 
 Fits  a  parabola  to  the data for the regions selected by the cursor.
 Both X and Y values are determinded by the cursor.  Each  cursor  value
 is entered by pressing the space bar.  After the last region, Press the
 "Q" key to quit.  
      TD:[4mFIT POLY TERMS=3 LIMITED VLOG X=RECURSOR[0m 
 This  is  the  same  as above, except that only X values are entered by
 cursor.  
4 NONLINEAR   
 Selects  nonlinear  fitting techniques.  If ON MINUIT is used to do the
 fit.  The ECHISQ, GRADIENT, TOLERENCE, REPEAT, and PRINTLEVEL are  used
 to  modify  the  MINUIT fit.  They are ignored for linear fits.  If you
 specify the option MINUIT you will enter interactive MINUIT mode.   You
 must  then  guide  the  fit using MINUIT commands.  In addition you may
 specify the maximum and minimum value for  each  coeffiecint  with  the
 CMINIMUM  and CMAXIMUM options.  You might also wish to pick an initial
 error for each coefficinent, and possibly an initial value.  

 The  nonlinear  errors  agree  with  the  linear  values  if you select
 ECHISQ=1.0.  Note:  Though Topdrawer  and  PAW  both  use  MINUIT,  the
 resulting  CHISQ disagrees by about a factor of 3.  The TOPDRAWER CHISQ
 seems to agree with the correct value by subtracting the  fitted  curve
 from the data and calculating SUM((Y/DY)**2)/(Points-Params) 

 The  linear methods are much faster and convergence is guaranteed if no
 numerical  errors  occurr.   Unfortunately  many  curves  can  not   be
 expressed as a linear combination of terms.  

 Most  linear  fits  may  be  performed  either  by  linear or nonlinear
 methods.  This may be useful in checking the accuracy  of  the  fitting
 techniques.  
 (Default:OFF, ON if GAUSSIAN or EXPONENTAIL) 
5 ECHISQ      
 Selects  the  difference  in  CHISQ  for calculating the error in the
 coefficients.  
 (Default:1) 
5 GRADIENT    
 If ON use the calculated gradient.  
 (Default:GRADIENT=ON, OFF for EQUATION) 
5 PRINTLEVEL  
 Selects  the MINUIT printlevel (-1 to 3).  Higher levels produce more
 detailed reporting.  
 (Default:PRINTLEVEL=-1) 
5 REPEAT      
 The number of times to repeat before giving up.  
 (Default:REPEAT=25) 
5 TOLERENCE   
 Selects  the  tolerence  for  fitting.   Fit stops when the estimated
 distance from the min chisq is 0.001*TOLERENCE*ECHISQ*CHISQ.  
 (Default:0.1) 
4 LOG/FULL    
 Types  the  result  of the fit on your terminal.  If you select LOG=OFF
 then the results of the fit are not typed on  your  terminal.   If  you
 select  FULL  then the error matrix as well as all result of the fit is
 typed on your terminal.  
 (Default:LOG=ON,FULL=OFF).  
4 OFFSET      
      OFFSET=n  If  non  zero the data is fitted as a function of (X-n).
 For non orthogonal functions such  as  plynomials,  you  should  always
 specify  the  offset  as the center of the region that you wish to fit.
 This will produce a better fit with lower errors on  the  coefficients.
 The  offset  is included in the a1 coefficent for GAUSSIAN fits, so you
 do not need to specify it.  
4 MESH        
 Selects  mesh  data.   Normally  mesh data is ignored when performing a
 fit.  
4 NAME        
 The  new  set  will  usually have a name consisting of a transformation
 name followed by the old set name.  If you specify a  new  name  it  is
 applied to the new data set.  If the name ends in "%" then the old name
 is appended to the new name.  See option:APPEND 
4 MONITOR     
 If selected it plots the original data and joins the fitted curve.  
 See:  SET MODE MONITOR 
 The  fitted  curve is joined using the SECONDARY attributes.  to change
 them use the SET SECONDARY command.  
4 POINTS      
 Specifies  the  range of points to use.  If n2 is omitted it is assumed
 to be n1.  You may specify the point number or the options FIRST,LAST. 
4 SCALE       
 Fits  the  LOG(X or Y)  to  the  base  e if a log scale is selected for
 X or Y.  see the command:  SET SCALE.  Similarly the option EXPONENTIAL
 fits LOG(Y)=series.  

                                 example
      TD:[4mSET SCALE Y LOG[0m 
      TD:[4mFIT TERMS=4[0m 
 Fits a polynomial LOG(Y)=a0+a1*X+a2*X**2+a3*X**3 
                                 example
      TD:[4mSET SCALE X LOG[0m 
      TD:[4mFIT TERMS=3[0m 
 Fits a polynomial Y=a0+a1*LOG(X)+a2*LOG(X)**2 
4 SETS        
 Specifies  the  range  of  data  sets  to  use.  If n2 is omitted it is
 assumed to be n1.  You may specify the data set number or  the  options
 FIRST,LAST.  
4 ORDER/TERMS 
 Sets  the  number of terms in a series or the order of the series.  The
 number of terms must be between 1 and 20.  The order (TERMS-1) must  be
 between 0 and 19.  
 (Default:TERMS=2) 
4 Y|Z         
 This selects the coordinate to fit.  By default Z is fit for MESH data,
 DPOLYNOMIAL, or DGAUSS.  Otherwise Y is fit.  
4 Warning     
 A fit may fail with floating point overflow when the number of terms is
 large.  Sometimes you may avoid this be rescaling the data to a smaller
 range,  and  fitting  the rescaled data.  Selecting an offset for X may
 also prevent errors.  

 For  example you have data with X ranging from 1 to 100 and Y from 0 to
 10.  When you try to fit the data  with  more  than  9  terms  you  get
 floating  overflow.   This may be prevented by rescaling X to be in the
 range .01 to 1.  
      TD:[4mX=X TIMES 0.01[0m 
 Then try performing the fit again.  

 Even if there is no overflow, a fit may fail if a large number of terms
 are selected, and the limit of the computer  accuracy  is  reached  (14
 digits).   Polynomials  are  particularly  sensative  to  this  type of
 problem.  In general polynomials should not be fitted to  more  than  9
 terms.  
4 Yerrors     
 The  error  bars  on the Y values are used as weighting factors for the
 fit.  If they are all 0.0 they are assumed to be  1.0.   The  resulting
 fit  has  error bars on the coefficients according to the assumed error
 bars on the Y values.  X errors are not used in the fit.  

 When  a  curve is generated, it will have error bars on the Y values if
 the fitted curve had non zero error bars.  For some functions the final
 errors  depend  on the initial center of the expansion.  This is set by
 specifying an offset (OFFSET=n).  Generally best results  are  obtained
 with an offset in the middle of the data set.  
4 examples    
      TD:[4mFIT POLY TERMS=10 INCLUDE EVEN[0m 
 Fits  a  polynomial  using  the  even powers of X.  (1.0,X**2...X**8) A
 curve with the resulting fit replaces the current data.  
      TD:[4mFIT LEGEN TERMS=3[0m 
 Fits  a  legendre  polynomial  of  3 terms.  (1,L1,L2) A curve with the
 resulting fit replaces the current data.  
      TD:[4mFIT POLY INCLUDE 2,3,5 CURVE APPEND FROM 0 to 10 by .1[0m 
 Fits a polynomial using X**2,X**3,X**5 and appends the histogram at the
 end of the current data.  The curve contains 101 data  points  spanning
 the range of X from 0.0 to 10.0 
      TD:[4mFIT POLY INCLUDE NONE COEF 1.0,.5,-.25 CURVE FROM 0 TO 10 BY .5[0m 
 Creates  a parabola Y=1.0+0.5*X-0.25*X**2 from 0 to 10 in steps of 0.5.
 Note:  that no fit is performed since no coefficints were included.  
3 FLUSH
      [4mFL[0mUSH  This  flushes  any  information  in  the buffers.  If you are
 plotting on an interactive device, from the terminal you can do the  same
 thing by hitting "return".  
3 FREQUENCY
 This is a synonym for BIN.  See the BIN command.  
3 HISTOGRAM
 Draws  a histogram from the specified data points.  Bin edges are halfway
 between the ends of adjacent error bars (DX), or halfway  between  points
 if no error bars.

4 CYCLE
 When  plotting  more  than  1  slice or data set, CYCLE causes the line
 texture, color, and width to vary from one plot to the next.  The order
 of  cycling  is  set  by  the SET CYCLE command.  If you have specified
 either texture, color or width it overrides the cycle value.  
4 FILL
 Generates a fill pattern under the histogram, or bar chart.  
4 FRAME
 This  option  specifies  that  the edge of the 3-d plot is to be always
 drawn.  If turned off  the  edge  is  not  drawn  when  the  data=ZMIN.
 Essentially this histograms only the "important" interior data.  
 (Default:FRAME=ON) 
4 EXPAND
 Sets  the  limits so that the selected data expands to fill the window.
 This has no effect unless POINTS, SETS, SLICES  are  specified  or  the
 limits on MESH data have been set by a SET LIMITS command.  

 See:SET MODE 
4 DEPTH
 DEPTH=OFF plots the mesh as a series of disconnected histograms, rather
 than as a solid.  Each histogram is drawn as a flat 2 dimensional hist,
 but  one  after  the  other.   Necessary  lines  to  delineate edges of
 different planes are included when a plot with depth is requested.   By
 omitting some lines the plot is much faster.  
 (Default:DEPTH=ON) 

 If  you wish to pick which axes is histogrammed you may use the options
 X,Y,Z 
4 HIDE
 Controls  whether hidden lines are drawn for a 3-d mesh, or whether one
 histogram hides the next.  You must specify HIDE for both the histogram
 to be hidden and the histogram that is to hide it.  The histogram which
 is drawn first will hide the second one.   HIDE=OFF  draws  the  hidden
 lines, while HIDE=ON omits them.  
 (Default:HIDE=ON for mesh, HIDE=OFF for data) 

                                 example
 Assume  you  have  2 data sets where you want set 1 to hide elements in
 set 2.  Also you would like to fill data set 2.  
      TD:JOIN SET=1 HIDE 
      TD:JOINS SET=2 HIDE FILL 

 You  can  produce a drawing of a mesh with hidden lines as dotted lines
 by doing the histogram twice:  
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM[0m 
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM HIDE=OFF DOTTED[0m 
4 POINTS|COLUMNS
 Specifies  the  range of points or the colums of a mesh to use.  If not
 selected all points are plotted.  If n2 is omitted it is assumed to  be
 n1.  You may specify the point number or the options FIRST,LAST.  
4 SETS
 This  selects  the  data  set to plot.  The data must be broken up into
 sets using the data set command, for this option to work properly.   If
 n2  is  omitted  it  is assumed to be n1.  You may specify the data set
 number or the options FIRST,LAST.  
4 SOLID
 This determines the texture of the line.  See:Command SET TEXTURE 
4 X|Y|Z|BLOCK
 For normal data X,Y,Z pick the dependent axis of the plot.  

 Mesh  data  produces  a  "solid"  plot.   The  limits  are set from the
 beginning of the first X,Y data point to the last.   This  may  not  be
 satisfactory if the bins at the edges are large.  

 The options X...  modify the format of the plot.  
      1.  X - Draws all bin edges in the X direction.  
      2.  Y - Draws all bin edges in the Y direction.  
      3.  Z - Draws all bin edges in the Z direction.  
      4.  BLOCK  or  LEGO  -  Draws  all bin edges.  It is equivalent to
          X Y Z.  
 This produces a block or "Lego" plot.  
4 XY
 XY|YZ|ZX  determine  which  faces are "shaded".  The shading is done by
 either drawing parallel lines, a cross from corner to corner or  random
 dot patterns.  The default is parallel lines.  
4 CROSS|RANDOM
 CROSS|RANDOM produce either a diagonal cross or a set of random dots as
 shading patterns on the selected faces.   DX  controls  the  number  of
 dots/face.  DX is the total number of dots to pruduce.  
4 DX
 DX|DY|DZ  are  the  separation between parallel lines used to shade the
 faces.  If zero parallel lines are not drawn.  

                                 Example
 You  wish  to  shade  face  YZ,ZX  with  lines  parallel  to the Y axis
 separated by 0.1 units.  Essentially this draws lines at even multiples
 of  0.1  units.  This may be used in a similar fashion to grid lines on
 1-d plots.  
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM YZ ZX DX=0.1[0m 
 Note:  you specify DX the distance along the X axis.  Since DY is 0, no
 lines parallel to the X axis are drawn.  When selecting RANDOM  shading
 DX specifies the number of dots/face.  
4 SLICES
           [SLICES [X|Y|Z] [[4mFR[0mOM] v1 [[[4mTO[0m] v2]] [CYCLE[=ON|OFF]] 
                or...  
           [SLICE X|Y|Z=v1] [CYCLE[=ON|OFF]] 

 This  plots a histogram sliced from mesh data.  This command is illegal
 for normal data.  If v2 is omitted then v2=v1.  If a range is  selected
 then  all  slices  within  the  range  are  histogrammed.   IF  you set
 THREE=OFF then the slices are histogrammed according to the first X,Y,Z
 Mentioned.   If  X  is first then the slices are taken perpendicular to
 the X axis.  You only need select X|Y|Z the first time you slice  after
 a NEW FRAME command.  
5 operation
 If THREE is ON then the histogram is sliced into a section between v1
 and v2.  The data outside of the range is omitted from the plot.  

 If THREE is OFF then each line/column of the histogram between v1 and
 v2 is plotted as a  separate  histogram.   If  both  v2  and  v1  are
 omitted, then all slices are plotted.  

 If  you  wish  to  add together a series of slices and plot them as a
 single histogram see:Command PROJECT.  
5 warning
 If  you  intend  to  use  options X,Y,or Z to control the format of a
 histogram they should not follow a SLICE command, or they  should  be
 separated from it by some other option.  
5 example
                              2-d Example
 You  read  in  a  mesh of data x,y vs Z.  X ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 in
 steps of 0.1 and Y from 100 to 200 in steps of 1.  Then you:  
      TD:[4mSET THREE OFF[0m 
 You wish to view a histogram of x vs Z for Y=140 and expand the scale
 so that the final plot fills the window.  
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM SLICE Y=140 EXPAND[0m 

 You now wish to view y vs z for values Y=.2 to .5:  
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM SLICE X FROM .2 to 0.5[0m 
      (This plots 4 histograms) 

 Now you wish to view all slices along the X axis:  
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM SLICES Y[0m 
      (This plots 100 histograms!) 
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM SLICE X FROM 0 to 0.5 Y FROM 105.5 to 110.0[0m 
 Plots  the  mesh  data as a series of slices looking along the X axis
 for a limited range of Y.  
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM SLICE Y=105 X FROM .25 TO .5[0m 
 Plots  the mesh data as a single slice looking along the Y axis for a
 limited range of X.  

                              3-d Example
 You enter mesh data in steps of 1 for Y=1 to 10, X=0 to 20.  
      TD:[4mHIST SLICE X=10.[0m  
 You are looking at X=10.  
      TD:[4mHIST SLICE X=10.  TO 20[0m 
 You are looking at X=10 to 20.  
      TD:[4mHIST SLICE X=10.  TO 20 Y=5 TO 7[0m 
 You are looking at X=10 to 20, Y=5 to 7.  
4 3-d_histograms
 A 3-d histogram can be either a plot of mesh data or a plot of "normal"
 x,y,z data.  Mesh data is normally plotted as a "solid".  XYZ  data  is
 plotted as a histogram of X vs Z in the plane determined by Y.  For all
 3-d  histograms  Z  must  be  the  dependent  variable,  and  X,Y   are
 independent.   Repeated  XYZ  plots may be used to build up a series of
 histograms.  

                                  [1m[4mNOTE[0m[0m
 Some  lines may be missing from the plot, because of the viewpoint.  If
 this happens you may need to:  
      TD:[4mSET THREE RDIST 1000[0m 
 This  moves  the  viewpoint  closer  to infinity, but maintans the plot
 size.  

 If  the  plot  is too large you may need to adjust the screen or window
 distance.  
      TD:[4mSET THREE DIST 1000 SCRD 300[0m 
 Will  reduce  the  size  of  the plot.  The size of the plot is roughly
 proportional to the ratio of SCRD to DIST.  

 If you specify color, intensity, or texture it is used for the top side
 of the mesh, while the default is used for the bottom.  

                                 example
      TD:[4mSET COLOR RED[0m 
      TD:[4mSET TEXTURE DOTS[0m 
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM SOLID WHITE[0m 
 Produces  a  mesh  plot  with bottom in dotted red lines, while the top
 side is drawen in white solid lines.  
4 variables
 Normally  for  2-d  plots  X  is  the independent variable and Y is the
 dependent one.  

 Normally  for  3-d plots X,Y are the independent variables and Z is the
 dependent variable.  

 The  bin  width is half way between the X or X,Y values if DX,DY are 0.
 If DX,DY are specified then they determine the bin width.  
4 limits
 The  limits  of  the  data  for  histograms is normally set so that the
 lowerlimit of the dependent axis with a linear  scale  is  0.0,  unless
 some data points are less than zero.  If you wish a different value you
 can:  
      TD:[4mSET LIMIT YMIN=n[0m 
           or for 3-d....  
      TD:[4mSET LIMIT ZMIN=n[0m 


                                 [4m[1mWARNING[0m[0m

      If  this command is issued in between 2 plots overlaying each
      other, they will not have the same scales.  


4 Shading_example
 Shading is produced by the options:  
      XY YZ ZX DX DY DZ CROSS RANDOM 
 If  you  wish  to  shade  the 3 faces differently, you must histogram 3
 times with each pattern you wish.  For example you wish parallel  lines
 on the YZ face, dots on the ZX face, and crosses on the XY face:  
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM XY CROSS[0m

 Interpolates  a  data set and puts the result into a new data set.  LEVEL
 is the number of intervals per pair of points.  If 2 a  single  point  is
 interpolated  in  between  each existing point.  If it is 5 then 4 points
 are interpolated.  X, Y, and Z if available are all interpolated.  

 The  data  must  be  strictly  monotonic  in  either  Y or X for a SPLINE
 interplation.  

 If  the  first  and  last  points  of  a curve are the same, the curve is
 assumed to be closed, and the interpolation is done accordingly.  If  the
 data  is POLAR or SPHERICAL then the angles must vary smoothly for proper
 closure.  
4 Options
      1.  LEVEL - Selects the number of subintervals from 2 to 10.  
          (Default:LEVEL=2) 
      2.  SPLINE|GENERAL   -   Selects   the  type  of  fit  to  use  in
          interpolation.  
          (Default:GENERAL) 
      3.  CLOSED  forces  the  interpolation  to  consider the data as a
          closed curve.  CLOSED=OFF will fil an unclosed curve even when
          the first and last points are identical.  
          (Default:data determines closure) 
      4.  POINTS - Selects the data points to use by number.  
      5.  SETS - Selects the range of data sets to interpolate.  
      6.  SELECT="name" - Selects the data sets by name 
      7.  LIMITED - Selects the points to use by a range of values.  The
          actual data selected will include  all  data  that  meets  the
          selection.   Some data outside of the range may be included to
          avoid breaking up a data set into multiple pieces.  
      8.  APPEND  -  Appends  the new data sets.  Otherwise the new data
          replaces the old set.  
          (Default:APPEND=OFF) 
      9.  NAME - Specifies the name for the new data set.  
          (Default:"Spline %" 
     10.  LOG - Summarizes the operations done.  
          (Default:LOG=OFF) 
4 notes
 The  spline  fit  is  based  on  the spline fitter from FXB$CG from the
 Stanford SPSS package.  

 The  general  fit  was  originally  adapted from ACM Algorithm #433, by
 Hiroshi Akima.  

 The  interpolation  by  n will not give the same results as joining the
 data by n, since the joininig is done after the data  coordinates  have
 been transformed into text coordinates.  
3 JOIN
 Joins the data points with a series of line segments.

4 level
 This is the number of line segments/point to use in joining the points.
 If omitted TOPDRAWER picks a suitable value 
4 CYCLE
 When  plotting  more  than  1  slice or data set, CYCLE causes the line
 texture, color, and width to vary from one plot to the next.  The order
 of  cycling  is  set  by  the SET CYCLE command.  If you have specified
 either texture, color or width it overrides the cycle value.  
4 ERRORS
 This puts error bars as vertical lines on a mesh plot.  
4 EXPAND
 Sets  the  limits so that the selected data expands to fill the window.
 This has no effect unless POINTS, SETS, SLICES  are  specified  or  the
 limits on MESH data have been set by a SET LIMITS command.  

 See:SET MODE 
4 FILL
 Generates  a  fill  pattern  inside  the  curve.   The  pattern will be
 generated so that alternate areas witin  the  curve  are  shaded.   The
 curve  is  assumed  to be closed with the last pont connecticted to the
 first one.  

 No  spline  or general fits are done to the data with fill.  The number
 of segements per point or level is assumed to be 1 with fill.  
4 HIDE
 Controls  whether hidden lines are drawn for a 3-d mesh, or whether one
 histogram hides the next.   HIDE=OFF  draws  the  hidden  lines,  while
 HIDE=ON omits them.  
 (Default:HIDE=ON for mesh, HIDE=OFF for data) 

 This  works  very  well  for curves which are functions of x, or curves
 that have at most 2 y values for a given x.  Curves with more than 2  y
 values  per  X  will  hide  the  entire  region from the minimum to the
 maximum y.  
4 SPLINE|GENERAL
 SPLINE  uses  a  natural cubic spline to fit the points.  Either x or y
 must be strictly increasing.  A GENERAL curve is  calculated  using  an
 algorithm  which  allows multiple-valued functions and repeated points.
 (Default:GENERAL) 
4 TEXT
 Use the TEXT coordinate frame instead of the DATA frame.  
4 LINES
 Specify which lines or rows of a mesh are to be used in the plot.  
4 POINTS|COLUMNS
 Specifies  the  range of points or the colums of a mesh to use.  If not
 specified all data points are used.  If n2 is omitted it is assumed  to
 be  n1.   You  may  specify the point number or the options FIRST,LAST.
 For 3-d plots this specifies the columns to use in the plot.  
4 SETS
 This  selects  the  data  set to plot.  The data must be broken up into
 sets using the data set command, for this option to work properly.   If
 n2  is  omitted  it  is assumed to be n1.  You may specify the data set
 number or the options FIRST,LAST.  
4 INTENSITY
 Sets line intensity or width (1-5).  
4 WHITE...
 Sets the line color.  See:Command SET COLOR.  
4 SOLID...
 Set the line texture.  See:Command SET TEXTURE 
4 X|Y|Z
 This  specifies  that mesh data is to be joined only in X,Y, or Z.  The
 default is to join in both.  
4 SLICES
 This plots data sliced from a mesh.  For more information see HISTOGRAM
 SLICE.  
4 3-d_plot
 This produces a mesh plot of the data.  Essentially the data points are
 joined in X,Y.  If you specify color, intensity, or texture it is  used
 for the top side of the mesh, while the default is used for the bottom. 

                                 example
      TD:[4mSET COLOR RED[0m 
      TD:[4mSET TEXTURE DOTS[0m 
      TD:[4mJOIN SOLID WHITE[0m 
 Produces  a  mesh  plot  with bottom in dotted red lines, while the top
 side is drawen in white solid lines.

 Repeatedly displays the selected histograms, or the last one selected by
 a SET HISTOGRAM command.  If more than 1 histogram are selected only the
 first 20 are displayed.  SEE:TOPDRAWER LINK and SET MONITOR 
4 AVAILABLE
 Selects currently available histograms rather than histograms in a
 global section or direct access file.  
4 EXACT
 Histogram names are treated as exact strings, and they are not searched
 in a case independent manner.  
 (Default:OFF) 
4 EXPAND
 Expands the histogram scales by omitting leading and trailing zero
 channels.  The histogram is also centered in the window.  You may also
 set limits on the Y scales of individual histograms by:  
      DEFINE HIST ID=n PRMIN=nlow PRMAX=nhigh 
4 ENTRIES
 YES selects only histograms with entries, while NO selects histograms
 without entries.  
4 FILE
 Selects the direct access file to monitor.  If FILE="" then the current
 one is used.  
4 IDENT
 Specifies the IDs of the histograms to display.  If this qualifier is
 not used, then the current histogram is displayed.  If IDENT is used
 without any parameters then all histograms are candidates for
 monitoring.  
4 INTERVAL
 Specifies the interval in seconds between updates.  
 (Default:10) 
4 LOG
 Types on your terminal the name of each histogram monitored.  If
 STATISTICS is selected then the statistics are also typed.  
4 MESH
 YES selects only mesh data (scatter plots), while NO selects only non
 mesh data.  Normally both mesh and nonmesh data are displayed.  
4 NAME
 Selects the histograms by name.  See SET or SHOW HISTOGRAM.  
4 OVERFLOWS
 Displays the overflow data in the first/last channels.  
 (Default:ON) 
4 PAUSE
 Selects pause mode rather than wait mode.  After each plot Topdrawer
 pauses until you press the "Return" key.  
 (Default:OFF) 
4 REPEAT
 Is the number of times to repeat.  It must be in the range of 1 to
 2147483647.  
 (Default:9999) 
4 RESCALE
 Selects whether hist is rescaled when it overflows.  Normally the
 TOPDRAWER automatically picks the scale of the displayed histogram.
 Then when it is too big to fit on the screen, it is erased and
 rescaled.  If you set limits before the MONITOR command, they are used
 to determine the scale of the histogram.  The histogram is not
 automatically rescaled, if the limits are picked or if RESCALE=OFF.  
 (Default:ON) 
4 SECTION
 Selects the global section to monitor.  If SECTION="" then the current
 one is used.  If neither FILE nor SECTION are specified then section is
 assumed unless FILE has been specified in a previous MONITOR HISTOGRAM
 or SET HISTOGRAM command.  SEE:TOPDRAWER LINK 
4 SCAN
 Displays all selected histograms, in order.  The screen is cleared
 between each update.  This allows you to look at more than 20
 histograms.  
 (Default:OFF) 
4 SKIP
      SKIP=n Skips the first n histograms which meet the selection
 criteria.  
4 STATISTICS
 Puts histogram overflow/underflow and sum on the line below the top
 title.  
4 SHOW
 Adds the hist ID to the lower right corner of each window below the X
 title.  
 (Default:ON) 
4 TIME
 Adds the time to the lower left corner of the display.  
 (Default:ON) 
4 TREE
 Search the directory tree from the current directory for histograms to
 monitor, that match the selection criterions.  
 (Default:OFF) 
4 WINDOWS
 Selects the maximum number of windows to use.  You may specify any
 number from 1 to 20.  
 (Default:20) 
3 MORE
 Adds more text after the last title with the same parameters as the last
 title.  It may also be modified by a matching CASE command, see TITLE.

 This  multiplies  the  (Y/Z)  values  in data set n1 by data set n2.  The
 result is a modified set n1.  You may not multiply mesh  data  by  normal
 2-d data.  
4 APPEND
 If  APPEND is specified, then a new data set is created, containing the
 result and set n1 is unchanged.  
4 CHECK
 CHECK=OFF  turns  off  data set checking.  When CHECK=ON both data sets
 must have identical X (and Y if mesh)  values,  but  data  set  n2  may
 contain  more  points than n1.  If (DX/DY) is non zero then the both DX
 and X must be identical within 1% of DX.  If you have  data  sets  with
 non  identical  values  of X you may create a set with identical values
 using the BIN command.  If the X values of 2 data sets  are  not  quite
 identical.   You may force TOPDRAWER to multiply them by setting DX for
 the data 100 times greater than the  difference  in  X  or  by  setting
 CHECK=OFF 
4 ERROR
 ERROR=OFF excludes the errors from the FIT in the computation.  
 (Default:ERROR=ON) 
4 FIT
 Specifies  that  the  data  set  is  to  be multiplied by the last FIT.
 See:Command FIT.  
4 LIMITED
 You  may  specify  the  limits  over  which  the  histograms  are to be
 multiplied.  If you specify the Y or  Z  limits,  then  all  data  that
 contains values inside these limits will be multiplied.  For example if
 you 
      MULTIPLY 1 to 2 LIMITED FROM Y=10 to Y=11 
 But data set 1 contains the followind data:  
 1,0;  2,10;  3,0;  4,11;  5,0 
 Points  2  to  4  inclusive will be multiplied, and only points 1 and 5
 will be omitted.  
4 LOG
 If  LOG  is  specified  then the result of the command is typed on your
 terminal.  
4 VECTOR
 The  DX,DY,DZ's  will be cross multiplied together assuming they form a
 vector.  The X,Y,Z are not changed, and  they  should  match  for  both
 input data sets.  
4 WEIGHT-EWEIGHT
 WEIGHT=n  specifies  a  weighting factor to multiply the data by before
 adding or subtracting it.  EWEIGHT=n specifies  the  error  on  WEIGHT.
 This option must precede the data set number.  
4 notes
 The  new value is Y3=Y1*Y2.  The errors (DY) are treated as if the data
 sets    are     uncorrelated.      DY3=Y3*SQRT((DY1/Y1)**2+(DY2/Y2)**2)
 See:Command ADD,DIVIDE.

 Starts a new picture.  Untreated points are PLOTTED before going on.  The
 old data points are retained until new ones  are  read.   Parameters  are
 returned  to  the  default values.  If the plot device is interactive and
 you are executing commands inside a file the program prompts:  
      PAUSE:  
 You  press  the  "Return"  key  to  start  the  next plot.  If instead of
 "return" you type in STOP, TOPDRAWER will stop executing the  input  file
 and return to command level.  You can also type EXIT, QUIT, HALT, END, or
 Ctrl_Z instead of STOP.  

 If  you  press  Ctrl_C  then TOPDRAWER will skip input until another STOP
 command is encountered, or the file ends.  Pressing Ctrl_C twice  rapidly
 in  succession  will abort all file input.  Pressing Ctrl_C twice rapidly
 in succession again will cause the program to ask  you  if  you  wish  to
 abort.  
4 ALIAS
 Each  picture  is given the name PICT001, PICT002 etc., but they may be
 given an alias name.  If the name is "" then name is Plot0001,  Plot002
 ...  
4 Comment
 The  "Comment on plot" is typed on your terminal, or written to the log
 file.  
4 RESET
 This  option  resets  all PERMANENT options to their original defaults.
 For example you have:  
      TD:[4mSET LIM FROM 1,2 TO 3,4 PERMANENT[0m 
 The RESET option will set them back to the default of no limits.  
                                  note
 The  STORAGE is not reset back to the default, and the existing data is
 not modified.  
3 PAUSE
      {[4mPA[0mUSE|[4mWA[0mIT} ['String'] [[4mFO[0mR n] 

 This  causes  TOPDRAWER  type the string and PAUSE.  This only works in a
 file or inside a repeat block.  You press the "Return" key  to  continue.
 If  instead  of  "return" you type in STOP, TOPDRAWER will stop executing
 the input file or repeat block and return to command level.  You can also
 type  EXIT, QUIT, HALT, END, or Ctrl_Z instead of STOP.  You may also use
 SET and SHOW commands while paused.  
4 FOR
 If  FOR  n  is  specified  then TOPDRAWER will wait for n seconds, then
 resume normal execution.  n may be in the range 0 to 200.  (Default:10) 

 example 
      TD:[4mREPEAT "NEW;SET HIST NEXT;HIST;WAIT FOR 10" 10[0m 
 Gets  the  next  histogram,  plots it, then waits for 10 seconds before
 plotting the next one.  
3 PLOT

 The  data points are plotted as a series of symbols with error bars.  The
 options AXES, OUTLINE, and GRID allow you to add specified elements to  a
 plot.  TABLE plots the actual values for the data as a set of numbers.  
4 options
      1.  AXES - Plots axes (if enabled).  You may specify where to draw
          the ticks.  
      2.  GRID - Plots a grid with specified locations.  
      3.  COUNTS - Controls the number of symbols/bin for a scatter plot 
      4.  EXPAND - Sets the limits so the specified set fills the window 
      5.  FILL - Fills in the symbols that are plotted.  
      6.  INTENSITY - Sets the intensity of the plot 
      7.  LIMITED - Limits the plot to a specified range of X,Y,Z 
      8.  [X|Y|Z]ERRORS=OFF - Disables error bars.  
      9.  RANDOM - Controls the number of symbols/bin for a scatter plot 
     10.  OUTLINE - Draws an outline around the plot (if enabled) 
     11.  SETS - Selects the data sets to plot 
     12.  SLICES - Selects the mesh data points to plot in 2-d.  
     13.  [NO]SYMBOL - Selects the SYMBOL to use when plotting.  
     14.  SIZE - Selects the symbol size.  
     15.  TABLE - Plots the values of the data points as numbers.  
     16.  VARIABLE  - Enables symbol sizes proportional to the value for
          scatter plots.

 Puts Axes and grid on the plot, but does not plot points.  This command
 is not usually necessary as axes are added  to  the  picture  when  the
 first  PLOT,  HISTOGRAM,  or JOIN command is executed.  If you use this
 command before a PLOT, HISTOGRAM or JOIN command,  then  the  automatic
 axes  are  not  produced.  The limits of the axes are determined either
 from the existing data or from the the SET LIMITS command,  or  by  the
 LIMITED  options.  The format of the axes is determined by the SET AXES
 command.  The origin of the axes may be specified after the option AT. 

      This  command  is mainly useful for special graphs where 2 sets of
 axes with different scales are needed.  This is also used to plot  axes
 on  a  3  dimensional  plot where x,y,z specify the origin of the axes.
 3-d plots do not automatically produce axes, so you must use  the  PLOT
 AXES command.  

      The origin may also be specified by the command SET THREE.  If not
 already specified by SET AXES, LABELS, or TICKS  commands,  the  color,
 texture, and intensity options will be used in plotting the axes.  
5 AT
 This allows you specify the data X,Y,Z at which the axis is plotted. 
5 FROM|TO|BY|N
 You  may specify a range of ticks with FROM,TO,BY,N.  You may specify
 any 3.  

                                example
      TD:[4mPLOT AXES X FROM 1 TO 10 BY 2[0m 
           or...  
      TD:[4mPLOT AXES X FROM 1 BY 2 N=5[0m 
 Draws ticks at 1,3,5,7, and 9.  
5 GRID
 If  specified  without  the  option AXES then a GRID is plotted.  The
 grid must be ON to be plotted.  See SET GRID.  If AXES is  specified,
 then  both  are plotted if the GRID is ON.  Grid lines or symbols are
 plotted only for long ticks.  

                                example
      TD:[4mSET GRID ON[0m 
      TD:[4mPLOT AXES Y 0 X 2,4,6,8 ticks 1,3,5,7,9[0m 
 The  grid  is  plotted  at ticks 2,4,6,8 on the X and 0 on the Y.  An
 axes is also plotted with labels at X=2,4,6,8 Y=0, and short ticks at
 X=1,3,5,7,9.  
      TD:[4mPLOT GRID Y 0 X 2,4,6,8[0m 
 Only a grid is plotted.  
5 HIDE
 Controls  whether  hidden  lines  are drawn for a 3-d axes.  HIDE=OFF
 draws the hidden lines, while HIDE=ON omits them.  This assumes  that
 the  axes  are  drawn in the normal position behind the plot.  It may
 not work properly for other positions.  You [4mmust[0m specify  which  axes
 are to be plotted.  
 (Default:HIDE=OFF) 
                                example
 For example histogram a mesh with hidden axes:  
      TD:HISTOGRAM ( Hist mesh data) 
      TD:PLOT AXES X Y Z HIDE ( Now plot only visible portion of axes) 
5 TOP...
 Produces  only  a  single axes at the TOP according to n1,n2....  You
 may also produce the axes to the LEFT,RIGHT, or BOTTOM.  For 1-d plot
 X  produces both TOP and BOTTOM axes, Y produces both LEFT and RIGHT,
 while Z produces only TOP.  On 3-d plots they produce X,Y, or Z axes.
 The axes are not produced if disabled by the SET AXES command.  

 After this option the tick values are assumed to be LABELS LONG.  
5 LABEL|TICK
 LABEL  selects  long  ticks  with  labels.  TICKS selects short ticks
 without labels.  Labels or ticks are not produced if disabled by  the
 SET LABELS or SET TICKS command.  
5 LIMITED
 If  this  option  is used it may be used to specify the length of the
 axis, with respect to the data.  
5 LONG|SHORT
 Selects  either  long  or  short  ticks.  This must be used after the
 LABEL or TICK command it modifies.  
5 FORMATS...
 These  determine  the  number  format.  They are analogous to FORTRAN
 formats.  
      1.  FFORMAT  - Numbers are written as nn.nnn or nn The number of
          digits to  the  right  or  left  of  the  decimal  point  is
          determined  by the data.  All labels for a selected axis are
          written with the same number of digits to the right  of  the
          decimal point.  
      2.  GFORMAT  -  Numbers  are  written  as  either  F or E format
          depending on the range.  For example if you  specify  labels
          from 0 to 1 by .25 they are written as.  0,0.25,0.5,1 
      3.  EFORMAT  - Labels are written as n.nn with an exponent power
          of 10.  
      4.  YEARS - Only the year is written 
      5.  MONTHS - The month is written 
      6.  DAYS - The day of the month is written 
      7.  TIME - The time is written.  
      8.  DATE - The date is written in the format dd-mmm-yyyy.  
 (Default:GFORMAT) 

                                 [1mNOTE[0m
 If the format is not G,F,or E then SMALL ticks are not reproduced for
 labels.  This allows you to place the label in any  location  without
 any ticks.  
5 n1...
 These  select  the  tick/label  locations.   If omitted then a set of
 default ticks and labels are chosen.  These are selected according to
 the SET LABELS and SET TICKS commands.  
5 restrictions
 You  may  not  specify more than 200 total ticks at one time.  If you

 in between the labels.  
      TD:[4mPLOT AXES BOTTOM LABELS 1,2,3 TOP 1.5,2.5[0m 
 Produces  labels  with  long ticks on the top and bottom of the plot.
 The labels are at different locations.  
      TD:[4mPLOT AXES X LIMITED FROM X=1 Y=5 TO X=11 LABELS 1,5,11[0m 
 This plots an X axis from X=1 to 11 Y=5 with labeled ticks at 1,5,11. 
4 COUNTS
 This sets the number of DOTS=ZMAX-ZMIN.  This is for data that consists
 of counts versus X,Y.  ZMIN,ZMAX are either automatically  set  by  the
 data set, or by the SET LIMITS command.  
4 CYCLE
 When  plotting  more  than  1  data  set, CYCLE causes the line symbol,
 texture, color, and width to vary from one plot to the next.  The cycle
 table  is  set  by the SET CYCLE command.  If you have specified either
 symbol, texture, color or width it overrides the cycle values.  

 When  doing  a  scatter  plot  of a mesh, CYCLE causes the symbol, line
 color and width to vary according to the cycle table.  

 When plotting a mesh table the color and width of each number will vary
 according to the CYCLE TABLE.  
4 EXPAND
 Sets  the  limits so that the selected data expands to fill the window.
 This has no effect unless POINTS, SETS, SLICES  are  specified  or  the
 limits on MESH data have been set by a SET LIMITS command.  

 See:SET MODE 
4 FILL
 Fills  the symbols to make them "more solid".  You will have to use the
 command SET FILL to achieve the desired effect.  Many symbols  can  not
 be  filled properly, so you must just try until you find a satisfactory
 one.  

 Of  the  normal  ASCII character set the "0O8SZ$" look pretty good when
 filled.  The centered symbol 1o, 2o, 6o, 8o look good when filled.   3o
 and 4o look bad when filled, while the rest to not fill at all.  
4 INTENSITY
 INTENSITY=n sets line intensity or width (1-5).  
4 LIMITED
 This  plots only those data points that fall within the specified X,Y,Z
 limits.  If no limits are specified, then the limits used are those set
 by  the SET LIMIT command.  This option has no effect on the density of
 dots or symbol size.  If a singe  axis  is  plotted,  then  the  limits
 determine the location and length of the axis.  

                                 example
      TD:[4mPLOT LIMITED FROM 1,2,3 TO 4,5,6[0m 
 Only points where 1<=X<=4 2<=Y<=5 3<=X<=6 are plotted.  

                                 example
      TD:[4mPLOT LIMITED FROM Z=.5 to Z=10[0m 
 Only points where 0.5<=Z<=10 are plotted.  
      TD:[4mPLOT LIMITED FROM Y=.01[0m 
 Only points where 0.01<=Y are plotted.  

                                 example
      TD:[4mPLOT LIMITED FROM CURSOR TO CURSOR[0m 
 The  cross hair cursor appears on the screen.  You move it to the lower
 X,Y and press the space bar.  Then move it to the upper X,Y  and  press
 the space bar again.  The points plotted will lie within the limits you
 set.  
4 ERRORS
 This  selects  plots  with  or  without  error  bars.  ERRORS=OFF plots
 without any errors, while XERRORS=OFF only  omits  the  X  error  bars.
 Similarly YERRORS=OFF or ZERRORS=OFF omit the Y or Z error bars.  
 (Default:ERRORS=ON) 

 If you wish to modify the appearance of the error bars see the command:
 SET BAR.  This modifies the size of the bar at the end of the errors.  
4 RANDOM
 RANDOM=n - Sets the maximum number of points per bin for a scatter plot
 (3-d) If RANDOM is not specified The number of points in a bin  is  the
 value  in the bin-Zmin+1.  The default RANDOM is limited to the range 1
 to 10.  If Zmax is less than 1.0 then the default RANDOM is set  to  5.
 No  points  are produced when the data equals ZMIN.  Zmin for a scatter
 plot is zero unless set by a SET LIMITS command.  

 If  the  contents  of  the bins range from 0 to 100 and RANDOM=10, Then
 each dot represents the value 10.  Any bin with  values  less  than  or
 equal  to  0  will  have no points plotted.  0.00001 to 10.0 will get 1
 dot, 10.00001 to 20 will have 2 dots and so on.  

 If  the  Z  axis  is  logarithmic  then  the  number  of points will be
 proportional to ALOG10(Z)-ALOG10(ZMIN).  

 NORANDOM  modifies  a scatter plot so that only one point is plotted in
 the center of each bin.  This option should be  used  with  either  the
 option LIMITED or VARIABLE.  
4 SOLID...
 Selects  the  texture  of  the plot.  This doesn not change the plotted
 symbol.  Error bars may be drawn as dotted or dashed.  
4 LINES|ROWS
 For 3-d plots specifies which lines or rows of the mesh data to list.  
4 OUTLINE
 Plots  the  outline around the plot.  Sections of the outline which are
 disabled by the SET OUTLINE are not plotted.  If not already  specified
 by  SET AXES,  or  OUTLINE  commands,  the  color, and intensity may be
 specified by the PLOT OUTLINE command.  
4 POINTS|COLUMNS
 Specifies  the range of points or the colums of a mesh to use.  For 3-d
 this is the range of column numbers.  
4 SETS
 This  selects  the  data  set to plot.  The data must be broken up into
 sets using the data set command, for this option to work properly.   If
 n2  is  omitted  it  is assumed to be n1.  You may specify the data set
 number or the options FIRST,LAST.  
4 SLICES
 This  scatter  plots  either a single slice or several slices from mesh
 data.  If THREE is OFF the first X,Y,Z determines the view along either
 the X,Y, or Z axis.  See HISTOGRAM for more details.  
4 SYMBOL
 SYMBOL=sym  specifies  the  symbol to use for plotting data.  Any legal
 UGSYS symbol may be used.  Points that do not already have a symbol are
 normally  plotted  using  the  default symbol (See:Command SET SYMBOL).
 The symbol you specify is used instead of the default.  You may  change
 the  color  and  intensity  of  a symbol, but it may not have a changed
 texture.  You can not plot symbols dotted or dashed.  

 NOSYMBOL specifies that all points are plotted with the default symbol,
 or the selected SYMBOL instead of the symbol assigned to each point.  

 If  you  want a centered symbol use 0o, 1o, 2o, 3o, 4o, 5o, 6o, 7o, 8o,
 or 9o.  Some characters from the ASCII character set are also suitable.
 "08OXNSYZ$*"  are  all  possible  characters  which  are  centered  and
 reasonably symmetrical.  Lower case characters are too  far  below  the
 center of the point.  
4 SIZE
 SIZE=n  is  the size of the symbol to plot.  If unspecified the default
 size is used.  See:Command SET SYMBOL.  
4 TABLE
                                 Options
           PLOT  TABLE  [[4mAT[0m]  [[4mAB[0mSOLUTE] [[4mDA[0mTA] [[4mVA[0mLUE] [[4mTO[0mP] [[4mOF[0mFSET=n|
           [[4mCU[0mRSOR]] 
 For  regular  data  points,  the value of the dependent variable (Z or Y) is
 drawn along the X axis as a number at the angle -90 degrees.  

 Mesh data is plotted as a table of numbers centered on the mesh points,
 The number is plotted horizontally.  

 The  size  of the numbers is adjusted to fit within the available space
 with a maximum size equal to the label size.  You may select  the  size
 by using the SIZE=n option.  
                                 Options
      1.  OFFSET=n  moves  the  table up or down by the selected offset.
          Normally it is specified in inches from the bottom data axis. 
      2.  DATA - The offset is specified in data units.  
      3.  VALUE - The offset is from the value of the data point.  
      4.  TOP - The offset is down from the top data axis.  
      5.  CURSOR - The cursor is used to select the offset.  
      6.  ABSOLUTE  - The offset is an absolute value from the bottom of
          the window.  
4 VARIABLE
 This  modifies  scatter  plots  so  that  the  size  of  the  symbol is
 proportional to Z-ZMIN.  Normally this is used with the  options  SIZE,
 NORANDOM, and VARIABLE.  
4 VECTOR
 This  plots regular data as a vector field.  Each data point is plotted
 as an arrow with  the  tail  located  as  (X,Y[,Z])  and  the  head  at
 (X+DX,Y+DY[,Z+DZ]).  The arrow head has a width equal to the BAR size. 
4 WHITE...
 WHITE, RED, BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW, CYAN, or MAGENTA sets the line color. 
4 3-d
 Mesh  data  produces  a  scatter plot if THREE is off and the dependent
 axis is Z.  If the dependent axis is Y or X then a series of slices are
 plotted of mesh data.  The scatter plot is truncated with zero dots for
 data equal to ZMIN, and the  maximum  number  of  dots  at  ZMAX.   The
 options  SYMBOL,  DOTS,  COUNTS,  NORANDOM,  and  VARIABLE  are used to
 control the look of the scatter plot.  In addition  by  setting  the  Z
 limits  and  using  the  LIMITED  option  you can control which data is
 plotted.  If the dependent axis is not correct for the desired type  of
 plot use the SWAP command to change them.  

                                 Example
      TD:[4mPLOT SYMBOL=1O SIZE=10 NORANDOM VARIABLE[0m 
 Plots  the  selected  symbol  in varying sizes.  It is 1.0" at ZMAX and
 nothing is plotted at ZMIN.  
      TD:[4mSET LIM ZMAX=4;  PLOT BLUE LIMITED[0m

      TD:[4mPLOT RED LIMITED FROM Z=4.0001[0m 
 Points Z=4 and lower are plotted in BLUE.  Points above 4 are RED.  

 The default for PLOT is THREE off.

 Forms 1 or more projections of mesh data parallel to one of the axes.  DX
 is set to half of the bin width and Y is either the sum or  average  over
 the  mesh  values.   If  available Z=the mean over the summed coordinate.
 This forms the projections from all selected mesh data.  
4 ADD|AVERAGE
 ADD|AVERAGE specifies whether the data is added or averaged to form the
 projection.  The default is to ADD the data.  This option must  precede
 the X,Y,Z that it modifies.  
4 APPEND
 If  APPEND is specified, then a new data set is created, containing the
 result and the original data is unchanged.  
4 INTEGRATE
 This produces a projection of the area under the curve.  The projection
 is the SUM( DY*Z ) if Y is specified.  If  AVERAGE  is  also  specified
 then  the  projections  is  divided by the SUM( DY ).  This option must
 precede the X,Y,Z that it modifies.  
4 SPLIT
 SPLIT=ON   splits   channels   to  preserve  the  total  sum  over  the
 projections.  For example X channels run from 0 to 1, 1 to 2 ...  9  to
 10.  
      TD:[4mPROJECT  X  FROM 0 TO 10 BY 2.5[0m Will produce 4 projections, but
 the sum over all projections will not be equal to the original sum.  
      TD:[4mPROJECT SPLIT X FROM 0 TO 10 BY 2.5[0m 
 Produces a set of projections and preserves the sum.  
 (Default:SPLIT=OFF) 
4 X|Y|Z
 This  specifies  the axis to project along.  If you specify v then only
 the row/column corresponding to v is projected.  If specified v1 and v2
 may  select  a  range of values to project.  If no values are specified
 then the entire mesh is projected.  If BY=v3 is specified then a series
 of  projections  are  made from v1 to v2 with a width of v3.  If N=n is
 specified then the range from v1 to v2 is split into n equal intervals.
 You  need  not  use this command if you wish to histogram only a single
 slice.  The SLICE modifier on the HISTOGRAM, or JOIN  commands  may  be
 used.   If X,Y, or Z are repeated then extra data sets are defined with
 projections.  
4 LOG
 Each projection is listed on your terminal as it is formed.  
4 SETS
 This  selects the data sets to project.  If n2 is omitted it is assumed
 to be n1.   You  may  specify  the  data  set  number  or  the  options
 FIRST,LAST.  All mesh data between n1 and n2 are projected.  
4 examples
 You read in a mesh of X,Y vs Z.  
      TD:[4mPROJECT Y FROM 5 TO 10[0m 
 Projects  the  Y slices corresponding to Y=5 to 10 onto the X axis, and
 2-d array of values is stored.  The new array of values is the  sum  of
 all  Z values corresponding to the range of Y values.  The mesh data is
 destroyed.  
      TD:[4mPROJECT Y FROM 5 TO 10 BY 2[0m 
 Makes 3 projections from 5 to 7, 7 to 9, and 9 to 10

      TD:DELETE SETS FROM <SET-1> 
 Projects both X and Y.  The projection along the X axis is in data next
 to last data set while along Y is in the last  set.   Both  projections
 are then histogrammed in separate windows.  Finally the projections are
 deleted.  
 Note:   This assumes only 1 mesh data set exists.  If n mesh sets exist
 then 2n projections will be formed.  

      TD:[4mPROJECT X 1 2.5 X 3 5 X 6 10;HIST[0m 
 Projects 3 different bands of data along the X axis.  All 3 projections
 are then histogrammed.

 This  reads  in  data to be plotted.  Once data is read, it is retained
 until it has been used to generate a plot.  It is then  discarded  when
 new data is read.  Normally you plot the data immediately after reading
 it.  When you start  a  new  plot,  the  data  last  plotted  is  still
 available  for replotting.  It is not discarded until new data is read.
 The option APPEND allows you to append more data to the already plotted
 data.   The  option SET starts a new data set.  If you do not specify a
 symbol when reading points, the default is determined by the  last  SET
 SYMBOL command.  

 This  command  is  not necessary, since TOPDRAWER assumes that a number
 not preceded by a command is automatically a point.   If  you  wish  to
 read data with the symbol as the first item, you must use the READ DATA
 command, and terminate the data with a blank line.  

 Values  that  are  omitted are initially set to 0.0, or to the previous
 value for that field.  

 When reading in data <XVALUE>, <DXVALUE>, <YVALUE>, ...  are the X, DX,
 Y, ...  values from the previous point.

 You  must  specify  the  points  as  an  array of X,Y,Z values.  If the
 attribute BINS is selected you specify the edge of the bins rather than
 the center of the bins and the optional END marks the end of the data. 
5 APPEND
 This  creates  a new data set containing mesh data.  If not specified
 or APPEND=OFF, all existing data will be deleted.  
5 ERRORS
 Storage  is  allocated  for  DX,DY,DZ.   You  must  enter  the errors
 following the values for the dependent variable.  The errors  on  the
 independent variables are equal to the bin width.  

                                example

5 Bin_spacing
 The  points/bins must be strictly monotonically spaced along the axes
 for good results.  

 If  a  histogram  has  unequal size bins, the last bin edge should be
 specified with the option END.  If this is not done, the bins may not
 be  properly  represented.   If  bin edges are not specified, The bin
 edges are half way between the points.  Mesh points are assumed to be
 centered within each bin.

 Restores histograms from files create by the HBOOK package.  FETCH,READ
 get histograms in the old HBOOK3 format.  Normally you do not  need  to
 specify  FETCH or READ as TOPDRAWER uses the file type to determine the
 operation needed to restore it.  
5 options
      1.  AREA  selects the directory of the disk file/global section.
          If  this  is  unspecified  then  the  subdirectory  on   the
          file/global  section  is assumed to be the same as specified
          by the previous SET HIST AREA command.  
      2.  FETCH  is  for histograms stored in machine dependent HBOOK3
          format by HSTORE.  Either all histograms or 1  histogram  ID
          may be fetched.  
      3.  FILE=file_name  selects the file name or global section name
          for the shared histograms.  If FILE is not specified then it
          defaults to HBOOK.BIN.  If the filename is NONE then no file
          name is selected.  
      4.  IDENT   Selects   the  ID  of  the  histogram  to  get.   If
          unspecified all histograms are fetched.  
      5.  INPUT  gets  histograms  from a direct access file in HBOOK4
          format.  This is the default.  
          [4mNOTE[0m  Topdrawer  checks  the file and will try to figure out
          whether to FETCH, READ, or INPUT the file.  
      6.  READ is for the machine independent HBOOK3 format.  
      7.  RELATIVE  saves  histograms  in  a  relative file for faster
          access.  Otherwise a sequential file is used.  
          (Default:RELATIVE=OFF) 
      8.  SECTION  gets  histograms from the specified global section.
          If    SECTION=""    the    current    section    is    used.
          SEE:TOPDRAWER LINK 
      9.  SHARE shares the file with other users.  SHARE=OFF prohibits
          file sharing.  
          (Default:SHARE=ON) 
     10.  VERSION  Selects the cycle (version number) of the histogram
          to get.  (INPUT only) 
     11.  IOFSET is added to the hist ID when fetched.  (INPUT only) 
     12.  APPEND Sets IOFSET=largest hist ID.  
     13.  ADD  adds  the new histograms to the current ones.  Normally
          all in the current directory are deleted.   ADD  works  only
          with INPUT, or with Global sections.  

          NOTE:   If  you  have a large number of histograms resident,
          you may not have enough memory to RESTORE ADD all  at  once.
          You may force TOPDRAWER to add one at a time by:  
               RESTORE HISTOGRAM ADD ID FROM 1 TO 99999 
     14.  SUBTRACT,MULTIPLY,DIVIDE  works in a similar fashion to ADD.
          SUBTRACT subtracts the new histogram  from  the  old  one...
          These do not work for HBOOK3 histograms.  
     15.  TREE  restores  the  entire  directory tree.  (INPUT/SECTION
          only) If this is selected along with AREA it is possible  to
          graft a file resident directory tree to a new root.

      4.  HISTOGRAM|MESH  selects  only  regular histograms or scatter
          plots.  
      5.  RECLENGTH specifies the record length for an RZ file.  
          (default:1024 Words) 
      6.  RELATIVE  saves  histograms  in  a  relative file for faster

          (Default:RELATIVE=OFF) 
      7.  SELECT selects the name of the histograms to store.  
      8.  SHARE shares the file with other users.  SHARE=OFF prohibits
          file sharing.  This works only for HBOOK V4.10.  
          (Default:SHARE=ON) 
      9.  UPDATE=ON saves histograms in an existing file.  
          UPDATE=OFF saves histograms in a new file.  
     10.  TREE saves the entire directory tree.  (OUTPUT,PUT only) 
 (Default:STORE,UPDATE=OFF) 
3 SET
 Sets options for plots.  These options usually revert to the default when
 a new plot is started.  
4 introduction
 The  set  commands  are used to set options.  Most set commands set the
 option for the duration of the current plot.  When  a  NEW  command  is
 issued,  the  options  revert to the default.  You may make the current
 option the default by using the option PERMANENT.  If  no  options  are
 specified for the set command, the options are set back to the original
 default value.  

 For  example  you  wish to do a series of plots with the same limits on
 the X,Y scales.   Normally  TOPDRAWER  sets  the  limits  automatically
 according to your data, so you use the command:  
      TD:[4mSET LIMITS X FROM 0 TO 10 Y FROM 0.5 to 1.5 PERMANENT[0m 
 which  sets  the  limits permanently.  When you have done the plots you
 wish to revert to the original default:  
      TD:[4mSET LIMITS[0m 
 Now the limits are reset to automatic limits for the current plot only.
 The next plot will have the PERMANENT limits.  To have automatic limits
 for all subsequent plots you must:  
      TD:[4mSET LIMITS;SET LIMITS PERMANENT[0m 

 After  using a set command you may "see" what you have done with a SHOW
 command.  For each set command there is a SHOW command which shows  the
 current  options.  For example you may see the limits you have modified
 by:  
      TD:[4mSHOW LIMITS[0m

 Normally  AXES  are  drawn  at the first HIST, JOIN, BARGRAPH, PLOT, or
 PLOT  AXES  command  unless  inhibited  or  turned  off.   To   control
 individual elements of the axes use:  
 SET TICKS, SET LABELS, SET OUTLINE, SET SCALES 
5 options
      1.  INHIBIT|ENABLE  -  inhibits  or  enables  the automatic axes
          generation for the current plot or window.  (Default:ENABLE)
          You   may   still   draw  the  outline  and  axes  with  the
          PLOT OUTLINE, PLOT AXES commands.  
      2.  ALL - enables axes for top, bottom, right and left.  
      3.  TOP - enables an axis for the TOP of plot 
      4.  BOTTOM - selects the axis for the bottom of the plot.  
      5.  RIGHT - selects the axis for the right hand side 
      6.  LEFT - selects the axis for the left hand side.  
      7.  X,Y,Z  - selects the axis to plot.  For 2 dimensional plot X
          turns on both top and bottom, Y  turns  on  both  right  and
          left.  
      8.  ON - allows drawing all three 
      9.  OFF - prevents drawing outline, label and ticks.  If an axis
          is off then no  space  is  allocated  for  either  ticks  or
          labels.  
     10.  INTENSITY  - Sets line intensity or width (0-5).  0 gets the
          intensity from the SET INTENSITY command.  
     11.  WHITE...  - Sets the line color.  
     12.  SOLID...    -   Sets   the  line  texture.   (Default:SOLID)
          See:Command SET TEXTURE.  
     13.  PERMANENT  -  Makes the current settings permanent from plot
          to plot.  
 This  acts  on  the  current plot only a new SET AXES is required for
 each plot or the options need to be made permanent.  The command must
 be  followed  by  either a HIST, JOIN, BARGRAPH or PLOT command to be
 effective.  
 (Default:ALL ON) 
5 Example

      TD:[4mSET AXES ALL ON TOP OFF RIGHT OFF[0m 
 This produces axes only on the left and bottom.  

      TD:[4mSET AXES X ON Y ON Z OFF[0m 
 This produces X,Y axes, but no Z axes on a 3 dimensional plot.

 All data past the length is ignored (Default:256) The length must be in
 the range 20 to 256.  See also SET FORMAT.  This parameter remains  the
 same when a new plot is started.  

 You should be careful when using this command.  If you extend the input
 line before extending the format, TOPDRAWER will expect multiple  input
 lines per command.  

 If length is omitted it is reset to the default value.  For interactive
 input on the VAX the length is 256 and it is  independent  of  the  set

 This  sets  the  base date for date\time values.  Date\time is normally
 expressed in hours.  However since it is only single  precision  it  is
 accurate  to only 7 digits or about 1 day on the date 1900.  If greater
 accuracy is needed you may set the base date  to  a  value  within  the
 range  of  time you need to express.  If you do not specify any options
 the base date is reset to the original default.

5 PORTRAIT
      LANDSCAPE or PORTRAIT 
 Select  the  orientation  of  the plot on paper.  This option applies
 only to printer drivers.  This applies to Gpostscript, EPS,  QMS1200,
 EXCL,  Versatek,  IMAGEN  and  all  DEC-GKS drivers that support page
 oreintation.  

 It  does  not apply to workstation windows or TEKtronix graphics.  To

5 TEST
 This  is  a  null  device.  You must specify the device driver in the
 "option_string".  
5 CALCOMP
 1.  SMALL CALCOMP - 10inch Calcomp 
 2.  LARGE CALCOMP 
5 EXCL
 This  if  for  laser printers using Talaris extended control language
 (EXCL).  This includes the Talaris 1590 printstation.  This device is
 capable  of  intensity (line width) variation, and erasing data.  The
 line width is the intensity/150 inches.  It produces a plot  11.0  by
 8.5 inches in size with 0.25 inch margins.  

 The  advantage  of  this  driver  over  TEK4010 on the Talaris is the
 number of line widths, and the correct reproduction of scatter plots.
 The  disadvantage  is  that  the file size is larger, and you can not
 send the file to a TEK-4010 emulator, to see the contents.  
                                [1mWarning[0m
 Previously  it  was  stated  that this will work on LN-03+.  Due to a
 misunderstanding this is not true.  For LN-03 printers use SIXELS  or
 TEK-4010 for LN-03+.

      3.  LM=n - The left margin in cm.  (Default:DM) 
      4.  BM=n - The bottom margin in cm.  (Default:DM) 
      5.  RM=n  -  The  right  margin  in  cm.   (Default:DM) If the
          margins are set to  0,  then  no  margin,  or  orientation
          commands are in the output file.  
      6.  PENLIST=n1n2n3n4n5  -  maps penwidths to number of pixels.
          Setting is number from 01 to 99.  1 pixel=0.0033  in.   If
          the   penwidth   is   00  then  the  default  is  assumed.
          (Default:0204060810) 
      7.  WIDTH=size   -   The   width   of   the   paper   in   cm.
          (Default:8.5in.) 
      8.  LENGTH=size   -   The   length   of   the   paper  in  cm.
          (Default:11.0in.) 
      9.  inches  -  The  WIDTH/LENGTH/margins  must be expressed in
          inches rather than cm.

     10.  XSIZ=<value> - Size of monitor in cm (Default:25.4) 
     11.  YSIZ=<value> - Size of monitor in cm (Default:25.4) 

5 HPGL
 This is for a generic Hewlett Packard plotter.  The plotter pauses in
 between each plot to wait for a new sheet of paper.  The  colors  you
 select are mapped to pen numbers as:  
      1.  WHITE 
      2.  Red 
      3.  Green 
      4.  Blue 
      5.  Yellow 
      6.  Magenta 
      7.  Cyan 
 Options are:  
      1.  WIDTH=n.n - Paper width in cm (Default:26.0) 
      2.  HEIGHT=n.n - Paper height in cm (Default:20.0) 
      3.  XSCREEN=n.n - X Offset of plot in cm (Default:0.0) 
      4.  YSCREEN=n.n - Y Offset of plot in cm (Default:0.0) 
      5.  UNITS=nn.n - Number of pixels/cm (Default:400) 
      6.  MAXCOLOR=n  - Maximum number of pens (Default:7) This may be
          set within the range of 1 to 7.  All pens  requested  larger
          than this value will revert to to the maximum.  
      7.  PENLIST=n1n2n3n4n5  -  maps penwidths to .01 cm.  from 01 to
          99.  (Default:PENLIST=0103050709)  01  is  the  minimum  pen
          width.  
      8.  GENIL  simulate  intensity  levels  by doing multiple passes
          with the pen.  If not specified then the PENLIST is ignored. 
      9.  PENWIDTH=n.n   -   The   width  of  the  pen  points  in  cm
          (Default:0.03) 
 If you wish to default to HP plotter output:  
      $ DEFINE PLOT_TERM "UGHPGLD[,options]" 

 These options may work differently depending on the plotter.  Most of
 the big plotters have the origin at the center of tha page, while the
 small  ones  use  an  origin  at a corner.  By suitably adjusting the
 WIDTH,HEIGHT,XSCREEN,YSCREEN any coordinate system or page  size  may
 be accomadated.  MAXCOLOR=1 is useful when you wish to reduce a color
 plot to a single color.  

                                example
      TD:SET DEVICE HPGL "PENLIST=0309152430" 
 Sets up to draw with much wider lines.  
5 IMAGEN
 This  is  for an IMAGEN laser printer using the IMPRESS language.  It
 has a resolution of 1/3150 in the horizontal direction.  Options are: 
      1.  ROTAXIS 
      2.  BIGMAR 
      3.  GENIL 
      4.  EXPA=LETTER or LEGAL 
 The default is to send output to UGS$IMGN300:  
5 POSTSCRIPT
 This  is  for  output  on a postscript printer It has a resolution of
 1/3387 in the horizontal direction.  The default output file name  is
 UGDEVICE.PS 
5 PRINTRONIX
 Printronix model MVP printer/plotter.  
5 QMS-1200
 This is the QMS Lasergrafix 1200 laser printer The options are:  
      1.  FLUNIT=n - Logical unit number (Default:29) 
      2.  TRAY=nnnn  -  4  character  code to specify the tray/stacker
          0000=upper tray, 0001=lower tray, XXXX=keep old setting.  
      3.  PENLIST=n1n2n3n4n5  - maps penwidths to setting.  Setting is
          odd number from 03 to 99.  (Default:0303050709) 
      4.  LANDSCAPE,PORTRAIT - Selects orientation 
      5.  LM,RM,BM,TM=n - Selects margins in inches (Default:0.9) 
      6.  NR,NC=n - Selects number of rows/colums of subplots on page.
          For example NR=2,NC=3 will plot 6 pictures on 1 page.  
          (Default:NR=1,NC=1) 
5 REGIS
 This  is  for  interactive  GIGI,  VT-240,  VT-241  color monitor, or
 suitable emulator such as  the  VT-300  emulation  on  a  VAXstation.
 (note:VT-241   can   only  reproduce  the  colors  RED,GREEN,BLUE  or
 WHITE,RED,GREEN).  The TEKTRONIX  driver  is  slightly  faster  on  a
 VT-240  than  the  REGIS  driver.  The physical screen size is set to
 10.56 by 6.6 inches or 26.85 by  16.76  cm.   These  devices  support
 Hardware  structure  and  hardware  characters in any size.  The GIGI
 also supports BLINK mode.  

6 options
      1.  COLOR=xxxxxxxx    This   specifies   the   color   mapping
          (default:WRGBYMCD)  You  may  modify  this  to  suit  your
          tastes.  This corresponds to the colors White, Red, Green,
          Blue, Yellow,  Magenta,  Cyan,  Dark(black).   The  eighth
          color "D" is the background color.  
      2.  HARDST  or  SOFTST  to  select  hardware, or software line
          structure.   HARDST  is  faster,  but  SOFTST  will   give
          identical results on all devices.  

                               Example
      TD:[4mSET DEVICE REGIS[0m 
 Sets up to plot on a normal REGIS device 
      TD:[4mSET DEVICE REGIS "HARDST,COLOR=WWWWWWWD"[0m 
 Sets up to plot quickly in black and white only.  
      TD:[4mSET DEVICE REGIS "COLOR=WRGBRGBD"[0m 
 Plots only in white,red,green, and blue.  Yellow, magenta, and cyan
 are mapped to red, green, and blue respectively.  
6 Answerback
 You  should  set the answerback to be "DECGIGI,COLOR=WRGWWWWD,<CR>"
 for a VT241 terminal.  
6 windows
 Normally  when  you do plots in REGIS the cursor is left at the top
 of the screen.  If your terminal is capable of more than 24  lines,
 you  may  wish  to  freeze the top 24 lines, and create a scrolling
 region underneath the plot.  Assume your terminal has more than  24
 lines  and  less  than  100.  This is possible if it is an emulated
 terminal using a windowing system.   To  move  the  cursor  to  the
 bottom of the screen:  
      TD:SET PROMPT BOTTOM,'TD:' 
 To freeze or thaw the top few lines:  
      TD:define            command            freeze           'type
 27,"7",27,"[24;r",27,"8",27,"M"' 
      TD:define command thaw 'type 27,"7",27,"[0;r",27,"8",27,"M"' 
 You  issue  the command FREEZE to freeze the top lines, and THAW to
 unfreeze them.  You will want to FREEZE when you are  doing  plots,
 and  the  thaw when you are showing data, or parameters, so you can
 use the whole window.  

 For your convenience you may do all of this by:  
      TD:SET FILE INPUT TOPDRAWER_DIR:FREEZE 

 Now  when  you  do plot the top part of your screen is used to view
 the plot while the bottom is used to give the commands.  

 If  your  screen  has only 24 lines you may wish to reduce the plot
 size and freeze the top 22 lines.  This will  give  you  a  2  line
 command window.  To do this:  
      SET FILE INPUT TOPDRAWER_DIR:FREEZE22 
 Similarly there is a FREEZE30 and FREEZE40 file.  
5 SIXELS
 This  is  for  the  LA-50, LA-100, VT-240, LN-03 and any other device
 that uses sixel graphics.  The size is about 10 by 8" except  for  an
 LA-100 which is 14 by 10.  To specify this device:  
      TD:[4mSET DEVICE SIXELS "type,options"[0m 
 Where  type  is LA50, LA100, VT240, LN03, LN03HI, LN03LO, or LN03MED.
 HI,LO,MED select the resolution for the LN-03 printer.  If you do not
 have  lots  of  memory  inside  the  LN-03  you  shoule use LN03LO or
 possibly LN03MED.  If you wish to get sixel output on a Talaris  1590
 printer  You  specify  option  LN03,  and  then  print  the file with
 /SET=LN03.  
                                example
      TD:[4mSET DEVICE SIXEL "LN03"[0m 
5 TEKTRONIX
 Tektronix 4010/4014 compatible terminals 
      TD:[4mSET DEVICE TEKTRONIX "type,options"[0m 
6 type
 1.  "RADM3A" - For ADM-3A+Retrographics terminal 
 2.  "RVT100" - A VT-100+Retrographics terminal 
 3.  "RVT100A" - High resolution Retrographics (Green screen).  
 4.  "SEL100XL" - For a Selanar HiREZ 100XL 
 5.  "VIS102" - For a Visual 102 with graphics.  
 6.  "KERMIT" - Kermit simulation of TEK-4010 with color 
 7.  "LSI7107" - LSI model 7107 color terminal 
 8.  "TEK4207" - For Tektronix model 4207 with Dialog box.  
 9.  "TEEMTALK"   -  For  Tektronix  4207  emulators  which  support
 simultaneous Tek and terminal windows.  
 10.  "VT240" - For a VT-240 terminal, or C.ITOH 328 For a VT-240 or
 241 terminal you will get better results using the REGIS  protocol.
 Both TEK and REGIS are supported on the VT-240.  When using the TEK
 protocol on a VT-240 the keypad is disabled in graphics  mode,  and
 the screen is erased when you leave graphics mode.  
 11.  "CIT467" - for a CIT-467 color graphics terminal 
 12.  "TAL1590" - for a Talaris 1590 laser printer.  This produces a
 plot approximately 10.24 by 7.8 inches with 3/8 inch margins.  
 If you do not specify a terminal type, then a plain vanilla 4010 is
 assumed.  
6 Terminal_setup
 It  is important that your terminal be setup properly for Tek-4010.
 The following settings must be observed.  
      1.  <CR> should generate only <CR> 
      2.  <LF> should generate only <LF> 
      3.  GIN  terminator  must  be  <CR>.  In particular you do not
          want <EOT> as a terminator.  
      4.  <DEL>  must be enabled as a valid graphics character or it
          implies Lo Y.  
      5.  You may wish to enable Automatic Tek entry.  
      6.  You probably do not want screen clear when Tek is entered. 
6 Falco
 The  Falco  infinity  series  can  display up to 49 lines of FBG-II
 graphics.  You should calculate the number of available y pixels as 
   For FBG-II 
      pixels=3120*(lines/49) 
   For FBG-I 
      pixels=3120*(lines/23) 
 Then you set:  
      TD:SET DEVICE TEKTRONIX "RVT100,YPIXELS=pixels" 
6 Options
      1.  "HARDST"   or   "SOFTST"  select  hardware  structure,  or
          software line structure.  HARDST  is  faster,  but  SOFTST
          will give identical results on all devices.  
      2.  "HIRES"  or  "LORES" select the resolution (4096 or 1024).
          HIRES is slower, and will only work on some devices.   For
          example HIRES messes up the plots on a Visual-102.  
      3.  "HARDCH"  or  "SOFTCH"  selects  the  range  of  character
          generation.   HARDCH  generates  4  character   sizes   by
          hardware.  SOFTCH generates only 1.  
      4.  "NOINTEN"  or  "INTEN"  selects intensity variation.  This
          only works on "real" 4010 terminals,  and  VT-240.   There
          are only 2 levels of variation 1,2,3 or 4,5.  
      5.  "HEIGHT=n"   selects   the  screen  height  in  cm.   This
          componsates for emulators without "good" aspect ratios.  
      6.  "YPIXELS=n"  selects  the number of Y pixels for emulators
          with a different number from the standard 3120.  This  may
          be  in  the range of 1024 to 4096.  Xpixels are assumed to
          be 4096.  
      7.  "WIDTH=n" selects the screen width in cm.  
      8.  "SLOW" selects full rather than compressed output for each
          point.  All redundant characters are transmitted.  
      9.  "RECSIZE=nnn" selects the record size (72-512) 
     10.  "RSEGM"  or  "NSEGM" - Selecte [no]return to terminal mode
          at end of each segment.  This is useful for terminals that
          support  simultaneous  ANSI, and Tek graphics on screen at
          the same time.  
     11.  "COLOR=WRGBYMCB"   -   specifies   the   8  color  mapping
          characters for White, Red, Green, Blue,  Yellow,  Magenta,
          Cyan,  Black.   Each  escape  sequence has a unique single
          character to select color, which may be specified  by  the
          color  option.   Spaces  indicate keep the color the same.
          For example KERMIT uses "COLOR=71243560" 
     12.  "PRECOL=sequence"  specifies  the "escape" sequence to use
          before the  color  character.   For  example  KERMIT  uses
          "PRECOL=[3" 
     13.  "POSTCOL=sequence" specifies the sequence to use after the
          color character.  For example KERMIT uses "POSTCOL=m" 
     14.  "ENTER=sequence"  specifies the "escape" sequence to enter
          TEK-4010 mode from terminal mode.  For example VT-240  and
          KERMIT use "ENTER='[?38h'" 
     15.  "EXIT=sequence"  specifies  the  "escape" sequence to Exit
          TEK-4010 mode to terminal mode.  This sequence is executed
          whenever  the  screen  is  erased  or  at  the end of each
          segment if RSEGM is  selected.   For  example  VT-240  and
          KERMIT use "EXIT='[?38l'" 

 NOTE:   It  is  assumed  that the escape character "27" begins each
 escape sequence, and it need  not  be  entered.   Escape  sequences
 containing lowercase letters need to be inside quotes.  In addition
 escape sequences are limited to  7  characters  and  they  may  not
 contain blanks.

 Sone  TEK4010  emulators  are  capable of simultaneous graphics and
 text where the graphics scrolls off of the screen.  An  example  of
 such  a  terminal is the Visual-630.  For this type of terminal you
 may wish to reduce the plot size and freeze the top 22 lines.  This
 will give you a 2 line command window with a fixed graphics window.
 To do this:  
      TD:SET FILE INPUT TOPDRAWER_DIR:FREEZE22 
 When you wish to use the whole window for listings you type:  
      TD:THAW 
 and then to restore the 2 line command window:  
      TD:FREEZE 
6 escape_seq
 Each  TEK4010  emulator  uses  slightly different escape sequences.
 The following is a listing of the sequences which differ  from  one
 device to another.  

      1.  ENTER Tek mode 
          A.  <ESC>[?38h - VT240,Kermit 
          B.  <ESC>#!1 - TEK4207 
          C.  <GS> - Most other devices 

      2.  EXIT Tek mode or Resume ANSI terminal mode 
          A.  <ESC>[?38l - VT240,Kermit 
          B.  <ESC>#!0 - TEK4207 
          C.  <ESC>2 - CIT467 
          D.  <CAN> - most other devices 

      3.  Set color (X=single color character) 
          (White,Red,Green,Blue,Yellow,Magenta,Cyan,Black) 
          A.  <ESC>[3Xm - Kermit X=71243560 
              The KERMIT color emulation uses <ESC>[3F;Bm 
              Where   F  is  the  Foreground  color  and  B  is  the
              background.  
          B.  <ESC>MLX - TEK4207 X=12347650 
              Alternate colors for TEK4207 are:  
              <         ;         :         9 
              Violet    Lt.Blue   Blue-Grn  Yellow-Grn 
              8         =         >         ?  
              Orange    Salmon    Dk.Gray   Lt.Gray 
          C.  <ESC>X - CIT467 X=oiljmknh 
          D.  <ESC>CX  - LSI7107 X=71243560 The LIS7107 additionally
              must return to terminal mode to setup a new color.  

      4.  Set mode ERASE/DRAW 
          A.  Color terminals use color black 
          B.  <ESC><RUB>/<ESC>a - RADM3A 
          C.  <ESC>1d/<ESC>0d - RVT100,VIS102 
          D.  <ESC>OW b` @@/<ESC>OW `` @@ - SEL100XL 
                           Codes (decimal)
 3.  <ESC> = 27 
 4.  <CAN> = 24 
 5.  <GS> = 29 
 6.  <RUB> = 127 
6 example
      TD:[4mSET DEVICE TEK "SEL100XL"[0m 
 Selects the SEL100XL terminal protocol.  
      TD:[4mSET DEVICE TEK "SEL100XL,SOFTST,LORES"[0m 
 Selects   the  SEL100XL  but  in  1024  resolution,  with  software
 structure.  This produces faster plots that look identical to those
 produced by hardcopy devices that do not have hardware structure.  
6 hints
 Some  terminals  such  as  the  KERMIT  emulation  do  not  support
 simultaneous display of graphics and text.  This may  be  fixed  in
 several  ways.   You  can  specify  the  "RSEGM"  option,  and do a
 SHOW CURSOR whenever you wish to look at the graphics page.  

      Some  terminals  such as the CIT328 , and the VT-240 clear the
 display when switching from graphics to text.  For such devices the
 "NSEGM" options should be specified.  This returns to terminal mode
 only when the device is closed, or when the screen is erased.  

      You  may  modify  the  actual  color mapping by specifying the
 appropriate escape sequences.  For example for KERMIT you may  draw
 black against a white backround by specifying:  
      SET DEVICE TEKTR "KERMIT,COLOR=01243567,POSTCOL=';7m'" 
 You  may  modify the color mapping for TEK4027 to substitute Violet
 for blue.  
      SET DEVICE "COLOR=' <' 
5 TEK4027
 This is for the Tektronix 4027 color terminal.  
5 VERSATEC
 Versatec  1200 printer/plotter.  The plotting space is 10.55" by 7.8"
 (26.8cm by 19.81cm) 2110 by 1560 pixels.  Plotting  nominally  begins
 0.35"  from  the perforations.  The 7.8" is nominal due to variations
 in the paper feed.  There is always a margin of 0.225" on  the  short
 side of the paper.  The following options may be specified inside the
 string.  
      1.  "LENGTH=n,inches"  - n is the length of the paper in inches.
          This allows you to make long plots on roll paper,  or  plots
          that  bleed across the page boundaries.  You can also make a
          plot smaller using this parameter.  

5 X-windows
 SET  DEVICE  XWINDOWS  for an X window display.  If you wish to serve
 the X-windows to another node on DECnet (HEPNET) you must declare the
 node before entering Topdrawer, by entering the line:  
      $ SET DISPLAY/CREATE/NODE=nodename 
 If  you  do  not  have a DECnet connection, but you are connected via
 TCP/IP (Arpanet or Internet)  you  must  use  one  of  the  following
 commands:  

 If you have Multinet TCP/IP software:  
      $ SET DISPLAY/CREATE/NODE=nodename/TRANSPORT=TCPIP 
 If you have Wollengong TCP/IP software (WINTCP):  
      $ SET DISPLAY/CREATE/NODE=nodename/TRANSPORT=WINTCP 
5 string
 This  is  passed  to  UGOPEN.   This selects options for the selected
 device.  The options are separated by commas.  For  more  information
 see:UGSYS.  An example of using the string is:  
      TD:[4mSET DEVICE SIXELS "LN03HI,NOCLEAR,NORESET,LENGTH=n,inches"[0m 

 This selects output for the LN-03 with no imbedded formfeeds or reset
 commands.  You might produce a plot in this form so you can add it to
 an existing text file.  The result is a plot imbedded in the text.  

 LENGTH=n  adjusts  the page length where n is the length of the paper
 in inches.  Shortening the plot size is useful  for  imbedded  plots.
 You may also lengthen the page length on the LA50 and LA100 printers. 

 If the option inches is omitted the length is in centimeters.  
5 ADD
 This  adds  another  device  so  now you have 2 device open.  You may
 select the unit number by using UNIT=n.  
5 FILE
 FILE=filename  -  This  selects  the  device and filename for output.
 This option only works for non-interactive or sequential devices.  If
 you  wish  to  specify  a  file  name containing either semicolons or
 blanks, it must be enclosed in parenthesis.  

 CHANNEL=DEV:   -  This  selects  the  output device.  For interactive
 devices or slave devices this is your terminal by default.  

 You  either  select  a  device  or  filename.   Interactive and slave
 devices generally accept CHANNEL,  while  sequential  devices  accept
 FILE.   The  TEKTRONIX  and  REGIS  devices treat FILE and CHANNEL as
 synonyms.  
5 WIDTH|HEIGHT
 Sets  the width and height of the display in the current units.  This
 only applies to some drivers.  
5 IDENT
 IDENT=aaaa  -  This  selects  an  identification  to  be  added  to a
 sequential output file before each plot.  For TEKTRONIX and REGIS, if
 aaaa='NONE'  then  there  is  no  identification  for each plot.  For
 VAXstations using NETWINDOW, the ident is  put  at  the  top  of  the
 window.   Normall  the  IDENT  is only 4 characters long, but for the
 VAXSTATION it may be up to 20 characters.  

 This is equivalent to "PICTID=aaaa" 
5 INTERACTIVE
 This  plots  on  your  terminal.  INTERACTIVE turns on both PAUSE and
 FLUSH.  When this is selected TOPDRAWER stops  after  each  plot  and
 waits  for you to hit the "Return" key.  If you wish to stop you type
 STOP, EXIT, QUIT, HALT, or END.  In addition data  is  flushed  after
 each  line  of  interactive input.  INTERACTIVE devices support extra
 features such as cursor input.  INTERACTIVE devices produce output on
 device  TT:.   If  you  attempt interactive output to TT:  in a batch
 queue, your output will vanish, as TT is assigned to NLA0:.  

 SEQUENTIAL - Produces plots in an output file 

 SLAVE  -  Produces  the  plots at another device.  This is similar to
 INTERACTIVE, but the CURSOR is not supported for a slave device.  

 The default is:  
      INTERACTIVE if you are running interactively 
      SEQUENTIAL in BATCH mode 
5 NUMBER
 NUMBER=nnnn  - This selects the sequence number for the first plot in
 the set.  This is only used by sequential devices.  
5 ORIENTATION
 This  is  an  integer value from 0 to 3 specifying the orientation of
 the plot.  It rotates all plots on all opened devices.  
      1.  Normal orientation 
      2.  Rotated 90 degrees clockwise.  This is the same as sideways.
          X goes from top to bottom, while Y points to the right.  
      3.  Rotated 180 degrees or Upside down 
      4.  Rotated 270 degrees clockwise 
5 REVERSE
 This reverses the foreground/background colors on the plot.  
5 SIDEWAYS
 SIDEWAYS  -  Rotates  the  plot by 90 degrees.  See:Command SET SIZE.
 This rotates all plots on all opened devices.  
5 PERMANENT
 This  sets the currently selected device as the Default.  The Default
 may be restored by a SET DEVICE command with no device specified.  
5 UNIT
 You may select the unit to open UNITS range from 1 to 8.  This allows
 you send the output to several devices at once.  
5 Example
 To get plots on your terminal a VT-100 with retrographics.  
      TD:[4mSET DEVICE TEKTRONIX "RVT100"[0m 

 To get plots on another terminal (TTAn:) a VT-100 with retrographics. 
      TD:[4mSET DEVICE TEKTRONIX "RVT100" FILE=TTAn:[0m  

 To get output on the Talaris printer:  
      TD:[4mSET DEVICE EXCL[0m 
 The  actual  output  will be a file called UGDEVICE.DAT which must be
 printed on the Talaris printer.  

 To get direct output to the Talaris printer:  
      TD:[4mSET DEVICE EXCL FILE=LPA0:UGDEVICE.DAT[0m 
4 DIAMOND
 This sets the default size for diamonds.  
 [4mSE[0mT [4mDIA[0mMOND [[4mSI[0mZE=dx[,dy]] [[4mPE[0mRMANENT] 

 PERMANENT - Makes the current setting the new default.  
 (Default:1.0) 

 If  dx is omitted it is set to the default.  If dy is omitted it is the
 same as dx.  
4 DIGITS
      [4mSE[0mT [4mDIG[0mITS=n 

 Sets  the number of significant digits displayed in a SHOW DATA command
 and the lexicals.  The number of digits may be set to a value from 0 to
 7.   If  n=0 then the number of digits is adjusted to suit the display.
 If n is omitted it is assumed to be 0.  (Default:DIGITS=0) 
4 ELLIPSE
 This  sets the default size for the major and semi-major ellipse sizes.
 If dy is omitted the ellipse becomes a circle.  
 [4mSE[0mT [4mEL[0mLIPSE [[4mSI[0mZE=dx[,dy]] [[4mPE[0mRMANENT] 

 PERMANENT - Makes the current setting the new default.  
 (Default:1.0) 

 If  dx is omitted it is set to the default.  If dy is omitted it is the
 same as dx.

      1.  DEFERRED  -  The  error  messages  appear  after  the  plot is
          finished.  
      2.  IMMEDIATE  -  The  error  messages  appear when the command is
          entered.  
      3.  LIST - The error messages appear only in the listing file.  
      4.  WAIT   -  When  error  messages  are  immediate,  WAIT  causes
          TOPDRAWER to wait after each message.  PAUSE is a synonym  for
          wait.  

 This option remains the same until changed by a SET ERRORS command.

 This  command  is  very  different  from  the  original SLAC version of
 TOPDRAWER.  
5 INPUT
 Selects the input file.  Once a file is selected, TOPDRAWER looks for
 all commands in that file.  After  the  last  command  in  the  file,
 TOPDRAWER    looks    for   more   input   in   the   current   file.
 (Default:TOPDRAWER.TOP) 

                                [4m[1mWARNING[0m[0m
      If   any  commands  follow  SET FILE INPUT,  they  will  be
      executed before the commands in the input file.  
5 LIST
 Selects  the  listing  output  (Default:TD.LIS).   This lists all the
 commands you give TOPDRAWER.  Both commands entered at the  keyboard,
 and from an input file are listed.  It is also the default file for a
 LIST command.  
5 JOURNAL
 Selects  the  journal  file  name  (Default:TD.TDJ)  The journal file
 contains any commands you type at the keyboard.  Commands from a disk
 file  are  not incuded in the journal file.  There is no journal file
 when TOPDRAWER is run from a batch job.  
5 filename
 The  file  specification  may  include  device and directory.  If the
 filename contains a semicolon ";", or begins with "V_" or "S_"  or  a
 special  character  such  as a dollar sign "$" it must be enclosed in
 quotes or apostrophes "'".  For example you may get the sample  input
 file.  
      TD:[4mSET FILE INPUT TOPDRAWER_DIR:TDINTRO[0m 

 This  is  a  modification  of  the  original  Topdrawer  syntax.  The
 original required a Fortran unit number.   By  performing  a  logical
 assignment you may simulate the original syntax.  For example:  
      $ [4mASSIGN FOR009.DAT "9"[0m 
 defines 9 as the usual input on unit 9.  
5 example

 This  selects a fill attributes to be used when the FILL option is used
 with HISTOGRAM, JOIN, or PLOT.  This selects the type  of  cross  hatch
 fill.  Up to 4 different lines may be used.  
      1.  ALTERNATE  selects filling alternate areas.  If off the entire
          area  bounded  by  the  outside  of  the  curve   is   filled.
          (Default:ON) 
      2.  ENTRY  selects  the fill entry to change.  If n is omitted the
          next entry is selected.  
      3.  FULL  sets  the  fill  size  to  be  the  same  as  the screen
          resolution, the angle is set to 90, and the WIDTH is set to 1. 
      4.  SOLID...  selects the line texture to use.  (Default:NONE) 
      5.  WHITE...  selects the line color to use.  (Default:NONE) 
      6.  ANGLE  the  angle  that  the  line  is  to  be drawn at.  0 is
          horizontal,   while   90   is   straight    up    and    down.
          (Default:+-45 degrees) 
      7.  SIZE  the  separation  between the lines.  If negative this is
          specified in pixels.  If positive it  is  specified  in  inch.
          (Default:0.1) 
      8.  WIDTH  selects  the  line width to use (0 to 5).  A width of 0
          indicates no width is selected.  (Default:NONE) 
 IF no options are specified, the fill patterns are reset to the default
 value.  
4 FIT

 See:Command FIT.  
4 FLUSH
      [4mFL[0mUSH [[4mON[0m|[4mOF[0mF] 
 This  selects automatic flush of plot data.  When automatic flushing of
 data is on, plot data is displayed immediately after  each  interactive
 line  of  input.   When  OFF  plot data is only displayed after a FLUSH
 command or when the plot buffer is full.   Pause  is  normally  on  for
 interactive devices, and off for non interactive.  
4 FONT
 This selects which fonts are used in generating plots.  
 [4mSE[0mT [4mFON[0mT [[4mBA[0mSIC|[4mEX[0mTENDED|[4mDU[0mPLEX] 
      1.  BASIC - 64 character uppercase font (not useful) 
      2.  EXTENDED - Full font with Greek and lowercase (Default) 
      3.  DUPLEX  -  Fancy  font.  This one may not look good on devices
          such as Tektronix 4010 with  limited  resolution.   This  also
          requires the most memory and time to generate.  

 This option remains in effect until changed by a SET FONT command.  The
 EXTENDED and DUPLEX fonts both use proportional spacing.  If  you  wish
 to use a fixed spacing font See:Command SET MODE PROPORTIONAL.  
4 FORMAT
 Sets the format used by the Fortran READ statement.  
 [4mSE[0mT [4mFOR[0mMAT "format" 

 This  is  useful  if  you wish to skip lines at the beginning of a line
 when you are using a list file as input to TOPDRAWER.  Normally you  do
 not  need to use this command, unless the data is in an extremely weird
 format.  The format is limited to 64 characters.  (Default:(256A1)  The
 number of columns is also limited by SET CARD.  This option remains the
 same until changed by a SET FORMAT command.  This option has no  effect
 on input you enter interactively at the terminal.  
                                 [1mExample[0m
 If you wish to skip the first 10 columns:  
      TD:[4mSET FORMAT "(10x,256A1)"[0m 
4 GRID
 This  causes  a grid to overlay the plot when axes are drawn.  The grid
 lines are lined up with the large tick marks.  This acts on the current
 plot  only  a  new  SET  GRID  is required for each plot or the options
 PERMANENT must be specified.  The command must be followed by either  a
 HIST, JOIN, BARGRAPH or PLOT command to be effective.

      3.  HORIZONTAL - Draws horizontal lines.  
      4.  VERTICAL - Draws vertical lines.  
      5.  INTENSITY  - Sets line intensity or width (0-5).  0 gets the
          intensity from the SET INTENSITY or SET AXES command.  
      6.  WHITE...  - Sets the line color.  (Default:Same as axes) 
      7.  SOLID...   -  Sets the line texture.  (Default:Same as axes)
          See:Command SET TEXTURE.  
      8.  SYMBOL  - Draws a symbol [sym] to be plotted at intersection
          of vertical and horizontal lines.  (Default:sym=0O) 
      9.  SIZE  - sets the size of the grid symbols If the size is not
          set then it is adjusted automatically by the window size.  
     10.  THETA,PHI  -  specify  the normal to the grid symbol for 3-d
          plots.  
     11.  ANGLE - rotates the symbol around the normal for 3-d plots. 
     12.  PERMANENT  -  Sets  the current grid options permanently for
          all NEW plots.  
 If  no  options  are specified, then all grid parameters are reset to
 the  original  defaults.   (Default:OFF  SYM='0O'   INTEN=0   NOCOLOR

 begins  with  "/"  then  it is considered to be a subdirectory of the
 root.  "" moves down the directory tree.  "AAAA" move up the tree  to
 subdirectory   AAAA.    and   "aAAA"   moves  over  to  the  adjacent
 subdirectory AAAA.  Note that "" may need to be enclosed  in  quotes,
 unless  you  have SET CHAR ALPHA "".  Unfortunately if you modify the
 meaning of "" then dates must be entered enclosed  in  angle  brakets
 <1989523>.    This   is  generally  not  necessary  unless  you  have
 directories which consist entirely of numbers.  

 If  you  use  "wild" characters in an area name then a directory tree
 search is automatically done using  the  wild  characters  to  select
 subdirectories.   Wild characters are "*" which means and string, and
 "%" which means any character.  

                                example
 Assume you are in directory "//PAWC/X" 
      TD:SET HIST AREA Y 
 moves you to //PAWC/X/Y 
      TD:SET HIST AREA "q" 
 moves to //PAWC/X/Q 
      TD:SET HIST AREA /A 
 moves to //PAWC/A 
      TD:SET HIST AREA // 
 moves to //PAWC 
      TD:SET HIST AREA /E* ID=2 
 Gets  the  first  histogram  with  ID=2  from  area  //PAWC/ENERGY or
 //PAWC/ERROR...  
5 CHECK
 If  on  it  TOPDRAWER  issues  a  warining  if  there  is a duplicate
 histogram for the selected one.  This is normally on except when  the
 options CURRENT, NEXT,PREVIOUS,LAST,FIRST are used.  
5 CONFIRM
 Each  histogram  that  matches the specifications is logged, then you
 are asked whether you want to accept it.  You reply:  
   [1m*[0m  Y,A - Yes accept it.  
   [1m*[0m  N - No, do not accept it (Default).  
   [1m*[0m  Q - Quit and stop asking questions.  
 If you omit ON or OFF then ON is assumed.  (Default:CONFIRM=OFF) 
5 ENTRIES
 If  ON  it selects only histograms which have entries (contain data).
 If OFF it selects only histograms without entries.   The  default  is
 ON.  
5 ERRORS
 Set the error array DY or DZ.  If this is specified for HBOOK and the
 histogram contains no errors, garbage may be collected in DY.  For  2
 dimensional  or RICE histograms the ERROR=SQRT(Y).  If you omit ON or
 OFF then ON is assumed.  (Default:ERROR=OFF) 
5 FILE
 FILE=filename  - Selects the filename to restore the histograms from.
 If IDENT is specified then the selected histogram is fetched from the
 file.  If the filename is NONE then no file name is selected.  If the
 filename is blank (FILE='') then the last opened file is used, or  if
 none has been opened.  
      HBOOK.BIN - For HBOOK4 direct access files.  

                                example
      TD:[4mSET HIST FILE=MY_HISTS.BIN[0m 
 Gets the histograms from file MY_HISTS.BIN.  
      TD:[4mSET HIST FILE="MY_HISTS.BIN;1"[0m 
 Gets histograms from the first version of the file.  
5 HISTOGRAM
 If  HISTOGRAM=ON  selects only histograms.  IDENT IDENT=nnn - Selects
 the histogram by id number.  The data in the histogram is loaded into
 the  data buffer.  If this is combined with NAME='hist_name' then the
 next histogram that first matches either the ID or NAME is selected. 
5 LOG
 This  causes  TOPDRAWER  to  type the histogram name when it sets it.
 The histogram ID,NAME,size, and range of  values  is  typed  on  your
 terminal.    If   you   omit   ON   or   OFF   then  ON  is  assumed.
 (Default:LOG=OFF) 
5 MESH
 If  MESH=ON  only  histograms  with 3-d or mesh data are set.  If you
 omit ON or OFF then ON is assumed.  

                                example
      TD:[4mSET HISTOGRAM NEXT MESH[0m 
 Gets the next mesh plot.  
5 NTUPLES
 You  may  select  the  NTUPLE  data  and put it into a 1-d histogram.
 These options remain the same, unless respecified.  If the option  is
 used  without  any  parameters it is reset to the initial value.  You
 may show the options by:   SHOW HISTOGRAM SELECT  These  options  are
 also  used  to control NTUPL usage by:  DEFINE HISTOGRAM ADD/SUBTRACT
 commands 
      1.  NTUPLES selects only NTUPLES.  Normall NTUPLES are excluded,
          so you must use this option to look at NTUPLE data.  
      2.  EVENTS  FROM  n1  TO  N2  selects  the event range The event
          selection remains the same, unless respecified.  
      3.  X/DX/Y/DY/Z/DZ=n selects the value to put into X/DX...  from
          each NTUPLE Initially they are X=1, Y=2, Z=3, DX=-1,  DY=-2,
          DZ=-3.  0 is the event number while positive values are each
          of the variables in an NTUPLE.  
      4.  NLIMIT=n  FROM  n1 TO N2 places limits on the selected value
          n.  Where n is the coordinate in the NTUPLE.   If  specified
          without  a  value n or with n=0 then all limits are set.  If
          all parameters are unspecified then all limits are reset  to
          large values.  
      5.  NMASK=n Sets MASK number n.  If 0 all masks are cleared.  
          A.  IDENT=n Will mask the data by histogram n 
          B.  X=m  Specifies  which Variable to check against the X of
              histogram n Zero is the event number.  
          C.  Y=m  Specifies  which  Variable  to  check  against Y of
              histogram n 
          The  data  is  checked  against  the  histogram  and  if the
          correspoinding bin of the histogram is non zero the NTUPL is
          kept,  and  discarded if not.  These options are also use by
          the DEFINE HISTOGRAM command to ADD or SUBTRACT  NTUPL  data
          from histograms.  

                                example
 You have an NTUPLE with 6 coordinate values A,B,C,D,E,F You may place
 all of the C values into X and the F values into Y While limiting the
 B values to the range -1 to 1.  
      TD:SET HIST ID=5 EVENTS X=3 Y=6 NLIMIT=2 FROM -1 TO 1 
 The resulting data may then be histogrammed using the BIN command.  
5 NUMBER
 The  number  of  hists to fetch when specifying FILE=name.  This only
 works it the ID was specified along with the FILE name.  

                                example
      TD:[4mSET HIST FILE=my_file IDENT=200 NUMBER=25[0m 
 Fetches  25  histograms from my_file beginning from number 200.  Hist
 number 200 is put into data.  
5 OVERFLOWS
 Selects  underflow and overflow data in the first and last bin of the
 histogram.   If  you  omit  ON   or   OFF   then   ON   is   assumed.
 (Default:OVERFLOWS=OFF) 
5 CURRENT|NEXT|PREVIOUS|FIRST|LAST
 Selects  the  current, next, previous, first or last histogram.  This
 may be modified by ID=n, NAME='hist_name',  MESH...   to  select  the
 next  histogram  with  the  desired  ID,  NAME,  or type.  When NEXT,
 PREVIOUS, FIRST or LAST are specified, no error messages  are  issued
 for duplicate histograms selected one.  
5 SECTION
 SECTION=SECTION_NAME  maps a global section to Topdrawer, for getting
 histograms.  If IDENT is specified then  the  selected  histogram  is
 fetched  from  the  global  section.  If the section has a blank name
 (SECTION="") the already mapped section is used.  SEE:TOPDRAWER LINK 

 To show available global sections:  
      $ INSTALL :==$sys$system:install/command 
      $ INSTALL LIST/GLOBALS 
 The  available  globals  sections  will  be  near  the  end under the
 category Group Globals.  
5 SELECT
 NAME='hist_name' Selects the histogram by name or title.  The data in
 the histogram is loaded into the data buffer.   The  entire  list  of
 histograms  is searched starting at the first one for a name matching
 the hist_name.  If a histogram has more characters in its  name  than
 the hist_name, the extra characters are ignored.  If the option NEXT,
 PREVIOUS, FIRST, or LAST is used, the search begins  from  the  NEXT,
 PREVIOUS,  FIRST,  or  LAST  histogram.  Percent '%' and star '*' are
 wild characters.  '%' means any single character while '*' means  any
 character string.  For example NAME='*ENERGY' will select a histogram
 name containing the word ENERGY.  However NAME='ENERGY' will select a
 histogram  beginning  with  the  word ENERGY.  NAME='*PI*ENERGY' will
 find all histograms with the name containing the string 'PI' followed
 by  the  word ENERGY separated by any number of characters.  The case
 of the hist_name is ignored.  

 If  more  than 1 histogram match the selected name, a warning message
 is issued.  
5 TITLE
 This plots the histogram name as a title.  The name may be split into
 4 parts, Top, X, Y, and Z by separating them with semicolons.  
      Top label;X label;Y label;Z label 
 If  the  number  of  lines  is  insufficient  for a title, then it is
 omitted.  For example you wish to omit the Y title so you:  
      TD:SET TITLE LEFT LINES=0 

 [1mWARNING[0m  For  3-D  histograms  the  title should not be plotted until
 after the histogram has been plotted.  If you omit ON or OFF then  ON
 is assumed.  
 (Default:TITLE=OFF) 
5 TREE
 Searches  the  entire  directory tree for the histogram starting with
 the current area.  This option remains set  from  one  SET  HISTOGRAM
 command  to  the  next.   You  may  only search a directory tree in a
 forward directions so this does not work for the option  PREVIOUS  or
 LAST.   Essentially  the  first  time  you  specify  TREE  the entire
 directory tree is setup  for  a  search.   Subsequent  SET  HISTOGRAM
 commands  should  not  use  the  TREE  option  unless a new search is
 desired.  
5 WILD
 If  WILD  is on then the characters "*" and "%" are "wild" and may be
 used in AREA names.  A wild character in an area causes  a  directory
 tree search, of only the selected subdirectories.  
5 WRAP
 If  WRAP  is on then when you SET HIST NEXT and the current histogram
 is the last one, the histogram number will wrap around to  the  first
 number.   Similarly  SET HIST PREVIOUS  will  wrap around to the last
 one.  If you specify WRAP=OFF then you will  get  a  warning  message
 instead  of  wrapping.  If you omit ON or OFF then ON is assumed.  By
 default WRAP is ON when TOPDRAWER is used interactively, but OFF when
 it is used in a batch stream.  
5 lexicals
 When  a  histogram  is  set  S_HIST_NAME  contains  the  the  current
 histogram name.  

 If  the  histogram package has limits or markers set on the histogram
 they are put  into  V_XMARKER[n]  and  V_YMARKER[n].   HBOOK  has  no
 markers.   The number of markers is limited to n=8.  The lexicals are
 set to a very large number 1.0E+30 if they do not contain markers.  
5 restrictions
 The maximum number of histograms you may restore is 499.  The maximum
 memory for  HBOOK  histograms  is  150,000  words.   (1.2 Mbyte)  The
 maximum title length is 256 characters.  If you have a file exceeding
 these restrictions you must restore each histogram individually by:  
      TD:[4mSET HISTOGRAM HBOOK FILE=name ID=n[0m 
5 examples
 The following sequence will plot a histogram stored by HSTORE.  
      TD:[4mRESTORE HIST FETCH FILE=filename (Get the hists)[0m 
      TD:[4mSET HIST ID=5;HIST[0m 
           or...  
      TD:[4mSET HIST NAME='title of hist 5'[0m 
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM[0m 

           or...  
      TD:[4mSET HIST HBOOK FILE=filename ID=5[0m 
      TD:[4mHISTOGRAM[0m 

      TD:[4mSET HIST NAME='ENERGY'[0m 
 sets the first histogram named "ENERGY...." into the data array.  
      TD:[4mSET HIST NEXT NAME="*ENERGY"[0m 
 sets the next histogram with a title containing the word "ENERGY".  
      TD:[4mSET HIST NEXT NAME='*ENERGY' CONFIRM[0m 
 types  the  name of each histogram containing the word "ENERGY", then
 you are asked if it is acceptable.  You type "Y" if it is, and  press
 "Return" if it is not.  
      TD:[4mSET HIST LAST HIST NAME='ENERGY'[0m 
 sets  the  last  1  dimensional histogram named "ENERGY...." into the
 data array.  
4 INPUT
      See command:  SET CARD 
4 INTENSITY
 [4mSE[0mT {[4mINT[0mENSITY|[4mWI[0mDTH} level [[4mPE[0mRMANENT] 
 This  sets  the intensity level or line width of a plot.  The permanent
 default is restored when a new plot is started.  

 level=1  to  5.   (Default:2)  5  is  the  brightest  (widest).   If no
 intensity is specified it is set to 2.  
 PERMANENT - Sets the current width to be the new default.  
4 LABELS
 This  sets  the  size  and enables the numeric labels on each axis.  To
 control the default number of ticks see SET SCALE.

      [[4mPE[0mRMANENT] 
 This  acts on the current plot only if PERMANENT not specified.  If the
 parameters are omitted they are reset  to  the  original  default.   To
 control other individual elements of the axes use:  
 SET AXES, SET TICKS, SET OUTLINE, SET SCALES 

 (DEFAULT:LEFT ON,BOTTOM ON) 
5 ALL|TOP|BOTTOM|LEFT|RIGHT
 Selects  labels  for top, bottom, right and left.  Top selects labels
 for the TOP of plot and so on.  
5 X|Y|Z
 selects  the  axis  to  plot.  Y selects both LEFT and RIGHT, while X
 selects TOP and BOTTOM.  
5 CHARACTERS
 CHARACTERS=n  specifies  the  maximum number of characters in left or
 right titles.  When setting up the windows room is allocated for  the
 specified  number  of  characters.  The room is only allocated if the
 corresponding axis and labels are enabled.  If  negative  the  actual
 number  of characters needed is used to locate titles.  LEFT or RIGHT
 titles are  only  moved  over  according  to  the  number  of  actual
 characters if they are plotted after the corresponding axes.  

                                Example
      TD:[4mSET LABELS CHARACTERS=4 PERMANENT[0m 
 All  plots  will allocate room for 4 character labels on the left and
 right.  
      TD:[4mSET LABELS CHARACTERS=-6[0m 
      TD:[4mPLOT AXES[0m 
      TD:[4mTITLE LEFT 'Flush title[0m 
 First the window is allocated leaving room for 6 characters, then the
 title is located according to the actual number of characters used to
 form the labels.  
5 INSIDE
 INSIDE=OFF  turns  off  labels for adjacent axes of negative windows.
 If you wish to plot data in a set of windows with the same scales and
 limits,  you may want to have each window flush against the next one.
 This is achieved  by  using  negative  windows.   Unfortunately  when
 plotting  the  axes,  you  will  get labels inside the windows.  With
 INSIDE=OFF you will only get labels on the perimeter.  

                                Example
 Assume you have 6 data sets to plot in separate windows.  
      TD:[4mSET LABELS INDIDE=OFF[0m

      [4mSET WINDOW 3;PLOT SET=3[0m 
      ....  
5 SIZE
 SIZE=n  is  the  character size in tenths of an inch Normally this is
 automatically set according to the paper size, and window to give you
 pleasing  results.   This  applies  to  all labels.  The units may be
 modified by SET UNITS CHARACTER.  
 (Default:2) 
5 SHIFT
 selects  the  amount  to shift the label from the edge of the plot to
 the center of the first character.  It is specified as the number  of
 characters.  This should be preceded by the option ALL,BOTTOM....  If
 the axis is not specified ALL is assumed.  
5 ON|OFF
 Allows  or  prevents  drawing  labels  This should be preceded by the
 option ALL,BOTTOM....  If the axis is not specified ALL is assumed.  
5 INTENSITY
 Sets  line  intensity  or width (0-5).  0 gets the intensity from the
 SET INTENSITY command.  
5 WHITE...
 Sets the line color.  
5 PERMANENT
 Makes the current settings permanent from plot to plot.  
5 examples
      TD:[4mSET LABELS ON SHIFT=2[0m 
 Selects labels on all axes shifted by 2.  
      TD:[4mSET LABELS RIGHT ON SHIFT=2[0m 
 Selects  labels for the right hand axis shifted by 2.  All other axes
 remain the same.  
      TD:[4mSET LABELS ALL OFF TOP ON RIGHT ON SHIFT=2[0m 
 Selects  labels  on the top,right axes only.  The right label will be
 shifted by 2.  The shift for the other axes remains the same.

 Limits define the space to draw the data.  They do not necessarily
 limit the data points plotted.  Normally limits are automatically set
 from all available data during the first plot.  If you read data, plot
 and then read more data and plot again, the first data set determines
 the limits.  This command allows you to set the limits of the plot
 independently of the data.  This should be used before the first PLOT,
 JOIN, HIST, or BARGRAPH command.  The limits are reset when a new plot
 is started.  If this command is issued without any limits specified,
 all currently set limits are removed.  
                                 [4m[1mWARNING[0m[0m
      If this command is issued in between 2 plots overlaying each
      other, they will not have the same scales.  

 See also:SET WINDOW 
5 SCALE
 This sets a uniform scale for both X,Y.  The window size is n1/n2 of
 the displayed X,Y.  If n2 is omitted it is assumed to be 1.0.  If
 both n1 and n2 are omitted, both x,y have the same scale as
 determined by the limits, and window size.  The plot is centered with
 respect to any selected limits.  
      TD:[4mSET LIMITS X 20,40 Y 40,60 SCALE 1 to 10[0m 
      TD:[4mSET WINDOW X 1 to 4 Y 1 to 2[0m 
 The X is displayed from 10 to 50 Y is displayed from 40 to 60.  
5 CURSOR
 CURSOR puts a cursor on the screen.  Move the cursor to the desired
 first limits.  Then hit the space bar.  Next move the cursor to the
 desired second limits, and again hit the space bar.  A new set of
 limits are now set for the next graph.  If you wish to set only the X
 limit hit "X" instead of "space".  Likewise hit "Y" or "Z" if you
 wish to set only Y or Z limits.  The new limits are entered into the
 journal file.  

 If both X limits are the same, then they are ignored.  Likewise
 identical Y or Z limits are ignored.  For 3-d data the limits are not
 changed.  Instead the parameters SCRD, THETA, PHI, and CENTER are
 adjusted.  The CURSOR option should be the last option in the command
 line for 3-d plots.  

 For example the following command will set new limits, and replot the
 current data:  
      TD:[4mSET LIM CUR;NEW;PLOT[0m 
5 PERMANENT
 PERMANENT sets the current limits permanently or until the next SET
 LIMIT command.  If you wish to unset permanent limits, set them
 permanently immediately after an NEW PLOT command.

 If ON|OFF is omitted ON is assumed.  Most of these options remain the
 same until explicitly reset.  They are generally not reset by a
 NEW PLOT command.  
 (Default:AUTOPLOT=ON, ABORT=ON, APPEND=OFF, CONFIRM=OFF, ERASE=OFF,
 DEBUG=OFF, ECHO=20, HARD=ON, JOURNALING=ON, LISTING=ON, LOG=OFF,
 MONITOR=OFF, PROPORTIONAL=ON, SHOW=OFF, TRACE=OFF, TREE=OFF, VECTOR=ON) 
5 AUTOPLOT
 If an EXIT or CLEAR command occurs and none of the current data set
 has been histogrammed, plotted, or joined, then it is plotted.  When
 AUTOPLOT is off no plotting is automatically done.  
5 ABORT
 If an error occurs during a command the command is aborted.  This
 applies generally to commands that produce output such as ARROW, BOX,
 CIRCLE, HISTOGRAM, PLOT, BAR, JOIN, and LIST as well as SMOOTH, BIN,
 X=, and so on.  It does not apply to the SET commands.  In addition
 ABORT just prevents journaling of inconvenient commands such as SHOW,
 SPAWN, and HELP.  
5 APPEND
 This is equivalent to using the APPEND option for all commands that
 create new data sets.  
5 CONFIRM
 This is equivalent to using the CONFIRM option for any command that
 uses this option.  When this mode is on you must confirm all data
 deletions with a YES, NO, QUIT, or ALL answer.  
5 CHECK
 CHECK=OFF is equivalent to using the CHECK=OFF option for commands
 such as ADD, SMOOTH, FFT, DEFINE HIST ....  It turns off the checks
 for appropriate data.  Usually this means that the data must be a
 histogram with equally spaced bins.  For commands that take 2 data
 sets there is the requirement that the data sets must match.  
5 DATAVECTOR
 This modifies the interpretation of DX,DY,DZ to be vector components.
 It modifies only the PLOT, ADD, SUBTRACT, and MULTIPLY commands.  
5 DEBUG
 Automatic flush at the end of each command.  If you SET FILE LIST=TT:
 and DEBUG=ON you can see each command and its result in order.  For
 compatability with previous versions NODEBUG is a synonym for
 DEBUG=OFF.  
5 ECHO
 ECHO=n selects n data points to be listed when read.  NOECHO is the
 same as ECHO=0 If you do not specify n it is assumed to be 1000.  
5 ERASE
 Selects erase mode for plotting.  While plotting in this mode The
 plotted data erases previous data.  This mode is reset to ERASE=OFF
 whenever a new plot is begun.  
5 EXPAND
 Selects EXPAND=ON whenever you PLOT, JOIN, or HISTOGRAM.  
5 FILECASE
 Selects the case of file names.  
      1.  Upper - File names are converted to upper case 
      2.  Lower - File names are converted to lower case 
      3.  Mixed - The case remains the same as typed.  

 If a file name is enclosed in quotes, then it is never converted.  
5 HARDTEXTURE
 Selects hardware or software texture generation.  
5 JOURNALING
 Turns on or off output to the journal file.  
5 LISTING
 Turns on or off the output to the listing file.  
5 LOG
 Turns on or off automatic logging.  Many commands use the option LOG
 to tell you what they are doint.  When logging mode is on these
 commands automatically log teir actions.  For example with LOG=ON
 when you use the MULTIPLY command, it informs you which data sets are
 multiplied.  
5 MONITOR
 This is the same as using the MONITOR option for all commands where
 it is legal.  For example if MODE MONITOR=ON then when you do a fit
 the result is automatically plotted.  
5 PROPORTIONAL
 Selects proportional or fixed spacing for the text.  
5 QUICK
 This turns off certain calculations to make plotting faster.  One
 side effect of this is to prevent proper centering or justification
 of titles, and labels.  If you wish both speed and proper
 justification, you can get proper justification for titles with no
 sub/superscripts by:  
      TD:[4mSET MODE PROPORTIONAL=OFF[0m 
 Plots can be made still faster by:  
      TD:[4mSET MODE VECTOR=OFF[0m 
 This only works if your output device has hardware character
 generation for the size characters you select.  
5 SHOW
 Show mode automatically generates a SHOW command after any
 SET command is used.  
5 TITLE
 Automatically plots the title of a data set along with the data when
 you use a CONTOUR, HISTOGRAM, JOIN, or PLOT command.  This is
 equivalent to specifying TITLE=ON along with the commmand.  
5 TRACE
 Produces traceback whenever an error occurrs.  For compatability with
 previous versions NOTRACE is a synonym for TRACE=OFF.  
5 TREE
 Setting mode TREE=ON is the same as specifying TREE=ON for any
 command that uses this option.  This is used when searching HBOOK4
 for histograms.  
5 VECTOR
 VECTOR=ON requires software drawn characters instead of hardware
 chars.  Character generation is slower, but more uniform.  Software
 characters are always drawn when a non blank case string is supplied,
 or if your output device can not produce hardware characters in the
 size selected.  You may request hardware characters by setting the
 title/label size to a negative value.  For compatability with
 previous versions NOVECTOR is a synonym for VECTOR=OFF.  
5 VLOG
 Enables Video logging.  When you use the cursor a Cross will be drawn
 at the selected cursor location, and a dotted line will be drawn
 around the resulting limits.  
4 MONITOR
 This sets the type of plot each monitor mode produces.  
 [4mSE[0mT [4mMON[0mITOR [{[4mAL[0mL|[4mDA[0mTA|[4mME[0mSH} {[4mBI[0mN|[4mCO[0mNTOUR|[4mJO[0mIN|[4mHI[0mSTOGRAM|[4mPL[0mOT

 The options may be any legitimate options for the type of plot
 selected.  If you do not supply any options then the defaults are used.

           ["prompt_string"] 

 This  sets  the  current prompt string with a maximum of 80 characters.
 If a null or blank string is used, then  there  is  no  prompt.   If  a
 prompt  has  imbedded blanks it must be enclosed in quotes.  The prompt
 string remains the same until a new one is selected.  
      1.  MAIN - Is the main prompt string.  (Default:"TD:") 
      2.  PAUSE  - Is the prompt string used when a NEW PLOT is started.
          (Default:"PAUSE:") 
      3.  ERASE  -  The  prompt erases the screen (ANSI terminal).  This
          erases text from a VT-1xx/2xx compatible terminal.  This  does
          not  erase  TEKTRONIX  graphics,  but  REGIS  graphics will be
          erased.  This must be precede the string.  
      4.  TOP - The prompt is at the top of the screen (ANSI terminal). 
      5.  BOTTOM  -  The  prompt  is  at  the bottom of the screen (ANSI
          terminal).  
      6.  BELL - This rings the bell for each prompt.  
      7.  nn - This inserts a control character (0-255) into the string. 
      8.  

 This  command  is useful for controlling the prompt for different types
 of terminals.  On some terminals you can control the  position  of  the
 prompt,  so  that it will not interfere with the plot, while on others,
 you may not want any prompts.  
5 Examples
      TD:[4mSET PROMPT MAIN TOPDRAWER:  PAUSE " "[0m 
 Changes the main prompt and sets no prompt for pause.

 To control other individual elements of the axes use:  
 SET AXES,   SET TICKS,   SET LABELS,  SET OUTLINE  (Default:ALL  LINEAR
 LABELS=6 TICKS=5) 
5 X|Y|Z|ALL 
 Selects  which  axis to set.  You may set all three axes with one set
 axes command.  
5 BASE      
      BASE=n - Selects the base for the plot.  
   [1m*[0m  LINEAR  this is useful for non-decimal units.  The labeled ticks
      are put at locations BASE*ROUND*POWER where:  
           POWER = a power of 10 1,10,100 
           ROUND = 1.0,1.0,2.5, or 5.0 
   [1m*[0m  LOG  scaling  large  ticks  are put at powers of the base.  This
      determines where ticks are put.  BASE 2 would put labels  at  1,
      2,  4,  8, 16,....  If exponential notation is selected then the
      base is used in the notation.  
5 DAYS      
 Values    are    the   number   of   days   from   the   base   date.
 See:Command SET SCALE TIME 
5 LABELS    
 This  selects  the  maximum  number  of  ticks with labels.  For more
 information See:LINEAR or LOGARITHMIC.  
5 LINEAR    
 Linear scale is used 
   [1m*[0m  LABELS - maximum number of big ticks with labels.  (Default:6) 
   [1m*[0m  TICKS - number of subintervals with unlabeled ticks.  SHORT|LONG
      determine whether the unlabeled ticks are  short  or  long.   If
      unspecified SHORT is assumed.  (Default:5 SHORT) 
 If TICKS=1 then there are no unlabeled ticks.  
5 LOGARITHMIC
 Log  scale  is  used.   Each  decade may be divided into subintervals
 corresponding  to  the  leading  digit  of  the   scale   (1,2...,9).
 -LOGARITHMIC generates a log scale for negative values.  
   [1m*[0m  LABELS=n1,n2..  - Specify which subintervals within a decade are
      labeled (2-9).  ALL labels all subintervals while NONE labels no
      subintervals.   If  you  specify  NONE  then no subintervals are
      labelled.  If EXPONENTIAL is specified exponential  notation  is
      used.  
   [1m*[0m  TICKS=n1...  - specifies which subintervals have unlabeled ticks
      (2-9).  ALL puts ticks on all subintervals while NONE  draws  no
      ticks.  SHORT|LONG determine whether labelled ticks are short or
      long.  If unspecified LONG is assumed.  Labelled ticks  at  each
      decade are always long.  
   [1m*[0m  DECADES=n  - (1 to 31) Specifies how often decades are labelled.
      For example DECADES=2 labels every other decade.  
   [1m*[0m  SUBTICKS=n  -  (0-9)  Specifies  how  many  subticks are between
      subinterval ticks.  If n is greater than 0 then long  ticks  are
      drawn  at  for  each  interval and n short subticks are drawn in
      between.  
 If  unspecified  labels, and ticks are picked for "pleasing" results.
 Generally if less than one half  decade  is  plotted  the  rules  for
 making  linear scales and ticks are followed.  Otherwise a maximum of
 6 or 7 labels are produced.  Exponential notation  is  only  used  if
 specified  or when the the label would exceed 6 digits or more than 3
 decades are plotted.  
5 MINUTES   
 Values   are   the   number   of   minutes   from   the   base  date.
 See:Command SET SCALE TIME.  
5 MONTHS    
 This selects labels of the form Jan, Feb etc.  This invokes a special
 scale where Noon Jan 1=1.01 An entire day is  from  1.005  to  1.015.
 1,13,25  are  labeled  January.  2,14 is February and so on.  No year
 titles are generated.  Every 4'th year is a leap year with 366  days.
 Year  1,2,3  are non leap years while year 4,6,8 are leap years.  The
 current year is number 1.  
      1.  LABELS - The value n specifies the maximum number of labels.
          SHORT,LONG generate either  1  Letter  labels  or  3  Letter
          labels.  (Default:1) 
      2.  TICKS  -  Specify  the maximum number of small ticks between
          labels.  SHORT,LONG specify  either  long  or  short  ticks.
          (Default:6 SHORT) 
5 NORMAL    
 The  scale  is  in  units  of standard deviation from the center of a
 normal curve.  MEAN, DEVIATION set  the  center,  and  width  of  the
 normal curve.  
5 POWER|ROOT
 This  sets  the scale to be the selected power or root.  N must be in
 the range 0.1 to 100.  If n is not specified it is assumed to  be  2.
 The  sign  of  the  axes  is preserved to avoid multiple values.  The
 rules for determining ticks and labels are the  same  as  for  linear
 scales.  

                                Example
      TD:[4mSET SCALE Y ROOT=3[0m 
 Y is scaled as Y'=SIGN(ABS(Y)**(1/3),Y) 
      TD:[4mSET SCALE X POWER=2[0m 
 X is scaled as X'=SIGN(ABS(X)**2,X) 
5 REVERSE   
 If this is specified before any data is plotter it makes the scale go
 from large to small rather than small  to  large.   For  example  the
 limits  on  the x scale are 0.0 and 1.1.  The left hand side of the X
 axis would be 0.0 and the right would be 1.0.  REVERSE makes the left
 hand side 1.0 and the right hand side 0.0.  

 If  this  is  specified  for  3-d plots after the data is plotted, it
 moves the origin of the axes to the other side of the specified axis.
 For  example  the  following  will plot axes along the sides of a 3-d
 cube.  
      TD:[4mplot axes[0m 
      TD:[4mset scale x reverse y reverse;plot axes[0m 
      TD:[4mset scale x reverse=off y reverse z reverse;plot axes[0m 
      TD:[4mset scale x reverse=on y reverse=off;plot axes[0m 
5 SECONDS   
 Values   are   the   number   of   seconds   from   the   base  date.
 See:Command SET SCALE TIME 
5 TICKS     
 This selects the maximum number of unlabeled ticks.  This varies with
 the type of  scale  selected.   For  more  inforation  see:LINEAR  or
 LOGARITHMIC.  
5 TIME-HOURS
 Values  are  the  number  of  hours  from  the  base  date.  Normally
 date/time may be expressed as YYY\MM\DD or  YYY\MM\DD\HH:MM:SS.SS  or
 HH:MM:SS.SS.   This  is  translated into the number of hours from the
 base date.  See:Command SET DATE.  You may have the  axes  labels  in
 date/time  format  by  selecting either a time or hour scale.  If the
 time is stored as seconds,minutes, or days then you  may  select  the
 scale appropriately.  
5 USER      
      USER=n1,n1...   specifies  the type of user scale.  This is only
 useful if you supply your own scaling  routines.   n1  is  the  scale
 type.   n2...n10  are  values  passed  to the user routine.  The user
 function is called:  
      Value=TDFNCT(X,SCALE) 
 X is the value to rescale.  
 SCALE(10) is the array of values n1...n10.  
 For example a log scale would be:  TDFNCT=ALOG(X) 
5 YEARS     
 Values are given by year and Julian day.  YEAR+DAY*.001 

                                Example
 Jan 1 1976=1976.001 
      1.  LABELS  -  Specifies  the  maximum number of labelled years.
          (DEFAULT:6) 
      2.  TICKS  -  Specifies  the  maximum  number of ticks per year.
          SHORT,LONG specify either long or short ticks.  
5 PERMANENT 
 sets the values permanently for the current axis.  Other axes are not
 affected.  Any values specified to the right of the option  permanent
 are not set permanently.  
5 Example   
      TD:[4mSET SCALE X LOG Y LINEAR[0m 
 Sets the X scale to logarithmic, and Y to linear.  
      TD:[4mSET SCALE X LOG SCALE 1,5 TICKS 2,3,4,6,7,8,9[0m 
 This  sets  the log scales on the X axis so that labels will be drawn
 at 1,10,100...  and 5,50,500...  All  subintervals  will  have  small
 ticks 2,3,4,6,7,8,9,20,30,40,60....  
      TD:[4mSET SCALE X LINEAR LABELS=10 TICKS=8 LONG[0m 
 Selects a linear scale for X with a maximum of 10 labelled ticks, and
 a maximum of 8 unlabelled ticks.  All ticks will be the same length. 
      TD:[4mSET SCALE ALL LOG Z LINEAR[0m 
 Sets X,Y scales logarithmic, and Z linear.  
      TD:[4mSET SCALE ALL LOG[0m 
 Sets all scales logarithmic.  
4 SHIELD
 Sets  an  area  to  be shielded.  Nothing may be drawn inside this area
 while shielded.  
 [4mSE[0mT [4mSH[0mIELD [=n] [[4mOF[0mF] [[4mDAtA|TExT] [FR[0mOM]|[4mTO[0m [[[4mX[0m=]nx,[[4mY[0m=]ny,[[4mZ[0m=]nz]]
           [[4mCU[0mRSOR] 

      1.  n - The shield number between 1 and 4.  If unspecified the
          next available shield is used.  

      2.  OFF - Turns the n'th shield off.  If n is not specied all
          shielded areas are turned off.  

      3.  FROM|TO - Allows you to specify the limit of the shielded
          area.  If no limits are specified the current window is
          shielded.  

      4.  DATA - Specifies the limit in data coordinates.  

      5.  TEXT - Specifies the limit in text coordinates.  

      6.  CURSOR - You use the cursor to specify the limits.  

                                 example
      TD:SET SHIELD FROM 1,2 to 3,5 
 Sets a shielded area in text coordinates.  
      TD:SET SHIELD DATA FROM Y=5 
 Shield all data from Y=5 for all X values.  
4 SIZE
 This sets the physical size of the plot.  Once set it remains the same
 until a new SET SIZE command is issued.  This command should only be
 used immediately after a NEW PLOT command or a SET DEVICE command.  It
 may not be used after any commands that plot data.

           [[4mTO[0mP=n] 
 If no options are specified the sizes are reset to the defaults.  
 (Default:NORMAL 13 by 10 inches MARGINS=0) 
5 x,y
 Set  the overall size of the plot The final size is the selected size
 plus the margins.  The actual size of the plot depends on the  device
 you  are  using.   The  x,y  are the size of the TEXT system.  If the
 final size plus margins is larger  than  the  physical  size  of  the
 display, the plot is automatically reduced to fit.  If the final size
 is smaller than the physical  size  of  the  device,  the  plot  plus
 margins is centered.  
5 UNITS
 Sets  the units of x and y.  For example UNITS=2.54 sets the units to
 centimeters.  This changes only the position  units.   All  character
 sizes  are  still  measured in tenths of an inch.  If you wish to set
 the units without changing the size of the plot or you wish to change
 the character size measurement use the command SET UNITS 
5 CM....
 This sets the units to a standard set of units.  
5 MAGNIFY|REDUCE
 Magnifies  or reduces the overall plot by the specified factor.  This
 modifies the entire plot  including  the  character  sizes.   If  the
 requested   final   size  is  too  big  for  the  device,  REDUCE  is
 automatically set to a value smaller than 1.   The  magnification  or
 reduction is limited to the range 1.0E-5 to 1.0E+5.  

                                example
      TD:[4mSET SIZE REDUCE=2[0m 
           or...  
      TD:[4mSET SIZE MAGNIFY=0.5[0m 
 reduce the plot from 13 by 10 to 6.5 by 5.0 inches in size.  
5 ORIENTATION
 This  is  an  integer value from 0 to 3 specifying the orientation of
 the plot.  
      1.  Normal orientaiton 
      2.  Rotated 90 degrees clockwise.  This is the same as sideways.
          X goes from top to bottom, while Y points to the right.  
      3.  Rotated 180 degrees or Upside down 
      4.  Rotated 270 degrees clockwise 
5 SIDEWAYS
 Rotates  the entire plot by 90 degrees.  If SIDEWAYS was specified by
 SET DEVICE, the plot is already rotated, in which  case  NORMAL  will
 rotate it back.  
5 MARGINS
 Sets the left,right,bottom, and top margins.  Any unspecified margins
 are set equal to the left margin.  If no margins are  specified  then
 all margins are set to zero.  
5 LEFT|RIGHT|TOP|BOTTOM
 Sets just the specified margin.  
5 examples
      TD:[4mSET SIZE 10 BY 13 SIDEWAYS[0m 
           or...  
      TD:[4mSET SIZE X=10 Y=13 SIDEWAYS[0m 
 This  rotates the normal plot from landscape to portrait and uses the
 full SHO LOpage.  
      TD:[4mSET SIZE Y=13[0m 
 Sets Y to 13 while leaving X at the previous settting.  
      TD:[4mSET SIZE SIDEWAYS[0m 
 This rotates the plot and it occupies 13 by 10.  
      TD:[4mSET SIZE 6.0 BY 9.0 SIDEWAYS MARGINS=1.15,.65,.775,.775[0m 
 This  sets the size and margins to produce a 1.5" margin on the left,
 and 1" on all other sides for a portrait plot on the VERSATEC.  
      TD:[4mSET SIZE 9.0 BY 13.5 SIDEWAYS MARGINS=1.725,.975[0m 
 This  sets the size and margins to produce a 1.5" margin on the left,
 and 1" on all other sides for a portrait plot on the VERSATEC.   This
 example  uses  a  9  by 13.5 drawing space instead of a 6 by 9 space.
 There will be an automatic reduction of .666667.

 This  sets  up to plot in spherical coordinates.  (R,THETA,PHI) instead
 of (X,Y,Z) 
      1.  ON|OFF turn the spherical coordinates on or off.  (Default:ON) 
      2.  PERMANENT - Sets these parameters permanently.  
      3.  DEGREES...  - Selects angle representation (Default:DEGREES) 
          A.  GRAD - (0-400) 
          B.  DEGREES - (0-360) 
          C.  PERCENT - (0-100) 
          D.  RADIANS - (0-6.2831853) 
          E.  FULLCIRCLE=n - (0-n) 

 You  still  set  the limits in X,Y,Z coordinates, and automatic scaling
 centers the origin.  When you plot,  the  axes  are  not  automatically
 generated  if spherical coordinates are on.  You must manually plot the
 axes with the command:  PLOT AXES.

5 LIMITED
 Limits  the  data  to the specified range.  For 3-d data the limit on
 the dependent variable is ignored.  If limits are not specified,  the
 default is the current plot limits.  See:Command SET LIMITS.  
      1.  X - Specifies X limit

5 LINES|ROWS
 For 3-d plots specifies which lines or rows of the mesh data to use. 
5 POINTS|COLUMNS
 This  specifies  which  points  to use.  For 3-d this is the range of
 column numbers.  
5 SETS
 This specifies which data set to use.  
4 STORAGE
 This  defines  what  is kept in storage.  SET ORDER automatically calls
 SET STORAGE if room for extra data is needed.  This option remains  the
 same until changed by a SET ORDER or SET STORAGE command.  The VAX uses
 virtual memory, so the actual amount of storage is not not limited, but
 expands  as  needed.   If you have a virtual memory allocation failure,
 you may prevent it by preallocating the needed  memory  with  the  SIZE

 (Default:SYMBOL,X,Y,DX,DY) 

 ALL  selects  all  coordinates.   If  this  command is used without any
 options, the storage is reset to the default.   If  all  3  coordinates
 X,Y,Z are included in storage, 3-d plots are turned on.  

 If   DX   is  selected  X  is  also  selected.   Likewise  DY,DZ,..DPHI
 automatically select Y....PHI.  SYMBOL, X and Y are always included  in
 the storage.  All other variables must be declared.  

 If  THETA  is  specified polar coordinates are enabled permanently.  If
 PHI is specified spherical coordinates are enabled.  

 SIZE=n  allows  you  to pick the number of words of storage to allocate
 for the VAX.  This is not necessary, but it may save time since you may
 preallocate the storage and avoid multiple automatic storage expansion.
 Normally the amount of storage needed for regular data is  about  n*d+4
 where  n  is  the  number  of points and d is the number of coordinates
 available in storage (SYMBOL,X,DX,Y,DY,....).   For  mesh  data  it  is
 ((n+1)*(m+1)+4)*d+4  where  n  and m are the mesh dimensions and d is 1
 for regular mesh data or 2 for data with errors.  If you  have  a  name
 for the data set it takes up 1 storage location for every 4 characters. 

                                 Example
      TD:[4mSET STORAGE X Y SYMBOL[0m 
 To see the current storage use the command:  SHOW STORAGE.  
      TD:[4mSET STORAGE SIZE=<4+101*201+20>[0m 
 Preallocates storage for a 100 by 200 mesh with an 80 character name.  
4 SYMBOL
 This selects the default symbol 
 [4mSE[0mT [4mSY[0mMBOL "xx" [[4mSI[0mZE=n] [[4mTH[0mETA=n] [[4mPH[0mI=n] [[4mAN[0mGLE=n] [[4mPE[0mRMANENT] 
 If  no parameters are specified the symbol and size are set to NONE and
 2 and the angles are turned off.  In other words SET SYMBOL is the same
 as SET SYMBOL=NONE SIZE=2.  

 This  command  determines  the symbol plotted data that have no symbol.
 If you SET SYMBOL before reading data the symbol  is  assumed  for  the
 data you are reading.  See:Command READ POINTS and PLOT.  
5 xx
 is  the symbol to plot 0O to 9O or any duplex character.  DOT or "  "
 produces a dot.  The second character in the xx pair selects the case
 or  font  to  use.   Only  plot symbols 0O to 9O are guaranteed to be
 properly centered.  If no symbol is desired specify NONE.  
5 ANGLE
 Specifies  the orientation angle of the symbol in a plot of 3-d data.
 This is the rotation angle around the axis  specified  by  THETA  and
 PHI.  
5 SIZE
 is  the  size  in tenths of an inch If the size is not set then it is
 adjusted automatically by the window size.  The units may be modified
 by SET UNITS CHARACTER.  
 (Default:2) 
5 THETA
 Specifies  the  polar  angle of the normal to the symbol in a plot of
 3-d data.  
4 PERMANENT
 Makes  the  current  symbol the permanent default.  Normally a NEW PLOT
 command resets the symbol to the permanent default.  
5 PHI
 Specifies  the  azimuthal angle of the normal to the symbol in a plot
 of 3-d data.  A negative value makes the symbols plot with the normal
 perpendicular to the screen.  In other words you are looking normally
 at the symbol for a negative value.  
5 3-d
 If  you  plot  3-d  data  and  PHI  is  greater than 0, the symbol is
 oriented according to the specified THETA, PHI, and ANGLE.  
5 example
      TD:[4mSET SYMBOL "$" SIZE=3.5[0m 
 plots dollar signs .35 inches in size.  
      TD:[4mSET SYMBOL 0O SIZE=10[0m 
 plots "X" 1 inch high.  
      TD:[4mSET SYMBOL GF[0m 
 plots uppercase Greek Gammas.  See:FONTS

 This  sets  the  default  texture  of  a  line  drawn by a BOX, CIRCLE,
 ELLIPSE, DIAMOND, PLOT, BAR, JOIN, or HIST command.  To set the Texture
 of  the  axes,  ticks, or outline See:Command SET AXIS, SET OUTLINE, or
 SET TICKS.  You may also specify the  texture  with  any  command  that
 draws.  For example you may JOIN DOTS or JOIN PATTERN and so on.  

      1.  SOLID - Solid line 
      2.  DOTS - Dotted line 
      3.  DASHES - Short dashed line 
      4.  DAASHES - Long dashed line (3x) 
      5.  DOTDASH - Dot-dash line 
      6.  SPACE - Adds an extra space between dots/dashes 
      7.  PATTERNED - Line determined by SET PATTERN.  
      8.  FUNNY  -  is  a dot at the ends of each line segment.  This is
          generally only useful for joined and smoothed curves.  
      9.  PERMANENT  -  Sets  the  current  texture  to be the permanent
          default.  

 (Default:SOLID) 

 If  no  options  are  specified it is set to SOLID.  When a new plot is
 started the texture is set to the permanent default.  

 If  you  specify more than 1 texture option, or use the option PATTERN,
 then a patterned texture is assumed and the pattern is generated.  When
 FUNNY  precedes  any  other  texture  specifier  then  it  is generated
 randomly.  
5 example
      TD:[4mSET TEXTURE DAASH[0m 
 This generates a "hardware" texture or long dashes.  
      TD:[4mSET TEXTURE DOT DOT DASH[0m 
           or...  
      TD:[4mSET PATTERN DOT DOT DASH;  SET TEXTURE PATTERN[0m 
 This  is  a dot-dot-dash texture, which is also set to be the current
 pattern.  
      TD:[4mSET TEXTURE DOT FUNNY DASH[0m 
           or...  
      TD:[4mSET PATTERN DOT RANDOM DASH;  SET TEXTURE PATTERN[0m

5 Options
      1.  CENTER=x,y,z  -  Is  the center of the 3-d view.  This moves
          the plot around.  
      2.  DIRECTION=xv,yv,zv   -   Controls   the  direction  you  are
          "looking" from.  
      3.  THETA=angle  -  The  direction  you  are looking from (polar
          angle) 
      4.  PHI=angle  -  The  direction you are looking from (Azimuthal
          angle) 
      5.  DISTANCE - Distance from you to the object.  
      6.  SCRD - Distance from you to the viewing window.  
      7.  RDISTANCE - Modifies DISTANCE + SCRD together (DISTANCE from
          you to object) 
      8.  REDUCE|MAGNIFY  -  Modifies  size  of the object relative to
          current size.  
      9.  ON|OFF - Turns 3-d plot on or off.  
     10.  AUTOMATICE - 3-d plots are on if the data is 3-d.  
     11.  ORIGIN=x,y,z - Set origin of axes for a PLOT AXES command.  
     12.  PERMANENT   -   Makes   current   parameters  permanent  for
          subsequent plots.  
     13.  SEPARATION=n  -  Specifies left, right separation for stereo
          plots 
     14.  LEFT - Specifies left eye view.  
     15.  RIGHT - Specifies right eye view.  
     16.  MIDDLE  -  Specifies  center  view  (neither  left nor right
          "Cyclops") 
     17.  VERTICAL=xv,yv,zv - Direction of vertical.  
     18.  WORLD=x BY y BY z - Limits on x,y,z coordinates.  
     19.  X|Y|ZANGLE=n  -  Specifies  orientation of labels and titles
          around axis.  
5 CENTER
      CENTER=x,y,z 
 The center of the picture in 3-d WORLD coordinates.  This defines the
 center of the object being viewed.   If  unspecified  it  is  at  the
 center of the WORLD size.  (Default:6.5,5,5 inches) 
5 DIRECTION
      DIRECTION=xv,yv,zv 
 Direction vector from CENTER to eye.  
      THETA=angle PHI=angle br;Alternate specification of DIRECTION in
 polar coordinates.  This is probably an  easier  number  to  specify.
 You  should specify either the DIRECTION or THETA and PHI.  These are
 specified relative to the VERTICAL vector.  

 PHI  is  the  angle in degrees from vertical to line through the eye.
 PHI is the azimuthal angle of the viewers eye.  (Default:60.0) 


                                [4m[1mWARNING[0m[0m

      The  alogorithm  used  in Histogramming or Joining the data
      requires that the viewpoint can not be "over" the structure
      being  plotted.  The hidden line removal algorithm will not
      work for an improperly placed viewpoint.  You should  avoid
      PHI=0 or PHI=180.  



 THETA is the angle between projections in the horizontal plane of the
 X-Axis and the line to the viewing  position.   THETA  is  the  polar
 angle of the viewers eye.  (Default:30.0) 

                                [1mExample[0m
 You wish to look at the plot from the +X axis:  
      TD:[4mSET THREE THETA=0[0m 
 You wish to lood at the plot from the +Y axis:  
      TD:[4mSET THREE THETA=90[0m 
5 DISTANCE,SCRD,RDIST
      DISTANCE=nnn 
 Distance from CENTER to the EYE (Default:35in.) 
      SCRD=nnn 
 Distance from screen or viewing window to EYE.  (Default:-18in.) 
      RDISTANCE=nnn 
 Same  as  distance, but the SCRD is changed also to keep the view the
 same.  (Relative distance) 

 If SCRD is negative then the actual SCRD is adjusted so that the view
 is the same independent  of  the  current  window  size.   If  |SCRD|
  = 0.5*DISTANCE then the plot will fill the current window.  

 Essentially  the  SCRD  is  the  distance from you to the screen, and
 DISTANCE is the distance to the object being viewed.   The  ratio  of
 SCRD/DISTANCE  determines  the  plot size while the absolute distance
 determines the perspective of  the  plot.   Large  distances  produce
 essentially  a  parallel  projection.  If you wish to modify the plot
 size use the MAGNIFY or REDUCE option.  

 Sometimes  vertical  lines  are  treated as being hidden when in fact
 they are visible.  This may be corrected by moving the view point far
 from the screen.  To set a distant viewpoint:  
      TD:[4mSET THREE RDIST=8000[0m 
 RDIST  adjusts  the  viewpoint  without  changing  the  size  of  the
 resulting plot.  
5 REDUCE|MAGNIFY
 These  change  the size of the plot without changing the perspective.
 REDUCE=0.5 or MAGNIFY=2 both increase the size by a factor of 2.  The
 SCRD  is  modified  but  not  the  DISTANCE.   The  magnification  or
 reduction is limited to the range 1.0E-5 to 1.0E+5.  
5 ON|OFF|AUTOMATIC
 This  turns  on  or  off 3 dimensional graphics.  AUTOMATIC specifies
 that 3-d graphics is determined by the data.  3-d is turned  on  only
 for  Mesh  data  or  if  all  3  coordinates  X,Y,Z  are  in storage.
 (Default:ON) 
5 ORIGIN
      ORIGIN=x,y,z 
 Sets  the position in DATA system at which 3 axes will intersect when
 drawn.  (For MESH data, PLOT AXES is needed to draw them) The  origin
 is normally set to be the minimum X,Y,Z value entered.  When set this
 value is used locate the axes and the title.  
5 PERMANENT
 This  makes  all  currently  set  parameters  the default.  Since the
 command line is parsed from left to right, options on the  left  side
 of this option are permanent, but options to the right are not.  When
 a new plot is started the current options  revert  to  the  permanent
 value.  
5 SEPARATION
 This  specifies  the  distance  between  the  true  viewing point and
 viewing   axis.    This   is   used   for   making   stereo    pairs.
 (Default:SEPARATION=0) 
      1.  LEFT - SEPARATION = -1.5 
      2.  RIGHT - SEPARATION = 1.5 
      3.  MIDDLE - SEPARATION = 0 
5 VERTICAL
      VERTICAL=xv,yv,zv 
 Direction  vector in WORLD system which projects onto a vertical line
 in the window.  (Default:0,0,1 - Z axis) 
5 WORLD
      WORLD x [[4mBY[0m] y [[4mBY[0m] z 
 This  sets  the  limits  in inches on x,y,z in the world coordinates.
 All data outside of these limits is clipped.  This is not set to  the
 default when a new plot is started.  (Default:13,10,10 inches) 
5 XAXIS
      XAXIS|YAXIS|ZAXIS angle 

 These  options are used to control how the ticks and labels are drawn
 relative to the axes.  If the angle is not specified or it is greater
 than  360 degrees the axes are drawn in either the XY,YZ, or ZX plane
 for  maximum  visibility.   The  angle  allows  you  to  rotate   the
 labels,ticks,  and  title around the axis.  The rotation is specified
 by permuting the axes XYZ.  For a given axis n the angle  0  lies  in
 the  n,n+1  plane,  and  angle  90  lies in the n,n+2 plane, with the
 labels in the negative side.  

                             Table of axes

 This gives the plane and direction of the labels.  The sign indicates
 the side the labels are drawn on.  
      Axis    0       90      180     270 degrees
      X       -XY     -ZX     XY      ZX
      Y       -YZ     -XY     YZ      XY
      Z       -ZX     -YZ     ZX      YZ

      TD:[4mSET THREE XAXIS=0[0m 
 This  draws the X labels and ticks in the XY plane with the labels in
 the negative X side of the axis.  

      TD:[4mSET THREE YAXIS=90[0m 
 This  draws the X labels and ticks in the YZ plane with the labels in
 the negative Z side of the axis.  
5 Revisions
 Originally  there was a major problem with TOPDRAWER.  The documented
 definition of THETA was not the same as the actual definition.  THETA
 was actually measured from the Y axis and positive valued put the eye
 closer to the positive  X  axis.   The  actual  definition  has  been
 modified  to  conform  to  both  the  documentation  and conventional
 notation.  If this is a problem, you may return to the old definition
 by:

      8.  SIZE=n - Character size for all titles 
      9.  WHITE...  - Title color for all titles 
     10.  ESCAPE - Sets the escape character for imbedded text/case 
     11.  SUBSTITUTE  -  Sets  the begin, end substititute characters.
          This allows you to include predefined text strings.  
5 ALL|TOP|BOTTOM|LEFT|RIGHT|X|Y
 Selects the title you wish to change.  (Default:ALL) 
5 INDEX
 Sets  the height of a title line.  The actual character height is the
 same as the size.  This determines the separation between 2 lines  of
 text  for  the  titles.   The INDEX applies to all titles LEFT...TOP.
 (Default:2) 
5 INTENSITY
 Sets  the title intensity or line width.  (0-5) (Default:NONE) 0 gets
 the intensity from the SET INTENSITY command.  
5 LINES
 Sets  the number of lines to reserve for a title.  For example if you
 wish to have a 2 line title at the top of the plot you should:  
      TD:[4mSET TITLE TOP LINES=2[0m 

 Negative lines puts the title inside the window.  
      TD:[4mSET TITLE BOTTOM LINES=-2[0m 
 puts  the  bottom  title  inside  the window and allocates room for 2
 lines of title.  (Default:1.2 BOTTOM 2) 
5 MARGIN
 This  sets  a fractional margin around each window.  Normally this is
 0.025 or 2.5% of the total window size.  You may set it to any  value
 from  0.0  to 0.4.  If you use relative or numbered windows the final
 window size is reduced by the margin as well as the number  of  title
 lines,  and  labels.   The margin is not absulute.  You may still put
 titles  inside  the  margin,  by  specifying  the   title   location.
 (Default:0.025) 
5 PERMANENT
 makes the current values the permanent values.  
5 SCALE
 This sets a scale factor on the title size.  Normally LEFT,RIGHT, and
 BOTTOM are 1.0 while TOP is 1.5.  This makes the Top title 50% bigger
 than  other  titles.   You may modify this to range from 0.1 to 10.0.
 (Default:1.0 TOP 1.5) 
5 SIZE
 SIZE=n  gives the approximate spacing between chars.  in tenths of an
 inch.  If n  is  negative  hardware  characters  will  be  used  when
 available.   If  n  is positive software characters will be used when
 mode  VECTOR=OFF.   This  size  determines  the  title  size  when  a
 TOP,BOTTOM,...   title  is  specified.  The TOP title is normally 1.5
 times this value.  Normally the size is automatically  set  according
 to the paper size, and window to give you pleasing results.  The SIZE
 applies to all titles LEFT...TOP.   The  units  may  be  modified  by
 SET UNITS CHARACTER.  
 (Default:2) 
5 WHITE...
 sets the title color.  (Default:NONE) 
5 windows
 When  you  specify  a relative or numbered window the window is first
 reduced by  the  margin  fraction.   Then  each  title  is  allocated
 INDEX*LINES*SIZE*SCALE  around  the  window.   Finally  the window is
 reduced to make room for labels.  Each title except  for  the  bottom
 will  be  positioned INDEX*SIZE*SCALE*(LINES-.5) from the edge of the
 window+labels.  The bottom is positioned INDEX*SIZE*SCALE/2 from  the
 window+labels.  
5 ESCAPE
 This  defines a character to use as an "escape" character.  After the
 escape character you enter a "text","case" pair.  This allows you  to
 imbed  text  case  pairs  in  the text, without using a separate case
 line.  When used with the substitution  you  can  define  macros  for
 expressions.   To output the ESCAPE character you must enter it twice
 followed by a space.  
                               example 
      TD:SET TITLE ESCAPE="@" 
      TD:TITLE TOP "This is a Greek alpha @AG" 
 Writes a title with an imbedded alpha.  
      TD:TITLE TOP "This an at symbol @@ ." 
 Writes the title:"This an at symbol @." 
5 SUBSTITUTE
 This  defines  a  pair  of  characters  to  delimit  a  substitution.
 Substitutions may not be nested.  You define a string,  and  then  it
 will  be  included  in  your  text  when the name is bracketed by the
 substitute pair.  When used with the escape character, you can  build
 complicated  expressions  and include them in your titles in a simple
 fashion.  If you need to output the begin  substitute  character  you
 should define a substitution for it.  
                                example
      TD:SET TITLE SUBSTITUTE="{}" 
      TD:DEFINE STRING curly "{" 
      TD:DEFINE STRING SEASONS "spring,summer,winter,fall" 
      TD:TITLE TOP "The seasons are {SEASONS}." 
 Writes the title:  
 "The seasons are spring,summer,winter,fall." 
      TD:TITLE TOP "A left curly bracket is {curly}" 
 Writes the title:  
 "A left curly bracket is {" 
      TD:SET TITLE SUBSTITUTE="" 
      td:title top "the seasons are seasons." 
 writes the title:  
 "the seasons are spring,summer,winter,fall." 
      td:set title substitute="" 
      td:title top "the seasons are seasons ." 
 writes the title:  
 "the seasons are spring,summer,winter,fall." 
5 examples
      td:[4mset title index=3[0m 
 increases the space per line to make room for sub/superscripts.  
      td:[4mset title top line=2.5[0m 
 allocates  room  for  2  lines  of title at the top, with a half line
 margin between the titles and the window.  
      td:[4mset title scale=1.0 right margin=0 bottom margin=0 line=-1[0m 
 sets  all titles to the same size and removes the margin at the right
 and bottom.  the bottom title is allocated 1 line of space inside the
 window.

5 reduce
 sets  the  units by the specified value.  this is the number of units
 per standard unit.  
5 all...
 this  selects  which  set  of  units  to modify.  there are 2 sets of
 units.  one is the text units which  specify  the  location  in  text
 space,  while  the  other is used to specify the character and symbol
 sizes.  the character units are also used to speicify the fill sizes.
 normall  text  sizes  are in inches while the character units are one
 tenth of the text units.

           [4min[0mside|[4mou[0mtside] 
 divides  the  entire screen into n2 windows of equal size, and sets the
 current window to number n1.  the windows are as  close  to  square  as
 possible.  

                                [1mrelative[0m
      set window [{[4mx[0m|[4my[0m} n1 [[4mof[0m n2]] [[4mle[0mvel=n]

      if  this command is issued in between 2 plots overlaying each
      other, they will not have the same scales.  


5 absolute
 the    window    may    not    exceed    the   current   plot   size.
 see:command set size.  if cursor is specified, the cursor may be used
 to  set  windows.  simply move the cursor to one corner of the window
 and hit the space bar.   them  move  the  cursor  to  the  diagonally
 oppostte  corner  and  hit the space bar.  the new limits are entered
 into the journal file.  

                                example
      td:[4mset window x from 1 to 6 y from 1.5 to 9.0[0m 
           or...  
      td:[4mset window from 1,1.5 to 6,9.0[0m 
           or...  
      td:[4mset window at 3.5,5.25 size=5,7.5[0m 
           or...  
      td:[4mset window x at 3.5 size=5 y at 5.25,7.5[0m 
 all produce the same window in inches.  
      td:[4mset window cursor[0m 
 you  move the cursor to diagonally opposite corners of the window and
 press the space bar to enter the cursor location.  
5 numbered
 a  numbered  window  is  a special type of relative window.  if n2 is
 omitted then the n2 is assumed to be the last n2.   both  n1  and  n2
 must  be  greater  than  or equal to 1.0.  n2 must be smaller than or
 equal to n2.  you may initially set up  a  window  as  relative,  and
 specify it as a set of numbered windows.  when you do this the window
 number modifies only the integer part of the  relative  window.   for
 example:  
      td:[4mset window 1 of 4[0m 
 this sets the lower left window out of 6.  
      td:[4mset window 6 of 6[0m 
 sets the upper right window out of 6.  
      td:[4mset window x 1.1 of 3.2 y 1.2 of 2.4[0m 
      td:[4mset window 5[0m 
           is the same as 
      td:[4mset window x 2.1 of 3.2 y 2.2 of 2.4[0m 
5 relative
 if  n2  is  omitted then the last n2 for the current plot is assumed.
 both n1 and n2 must be larger than 0.8 and n1 may not be larger  than
 1.2*n2.  if both n1 and n2 are positive the window is reduced in size
 to allow for labels and titles.  if negative the window occupies  the
 entire  space.   if  you  do not specify a fixed symbol, grid, label,
 title, or tick size then they are adjusted to be in proportion to the
 window  size.   absolute  windows  do not adjust the sizes.  if n2 is
 omitted then the current n2 is assumed.  

 for  windows which do not occupy the entire space, the actual size of
 the window depends on the location and position of labels and titles.
 the size is set to allow a 5% border with room for titles and labels.
 the default is a window with approximately 8.5% left on the right and
 top for titles, and 13% on the bottom and left for labels and titles.
 for 3-d plots it is assumed that no  labels  will  be  produced.   to
 change the size available for titles and labels use the set title and
 set labels commands.  

 non  integral  n1  or n2 may be used for fine adjustment.  if you use
 negative windows you  may  also  need  to  turn  off  inside  labels.
 see:command set labels inside 
6 example
      td:[4mset window y 1.2 of 2.5[0m 
 divides  y  into  2.5  windows  and sets the current window to 1.2.
 assuming the y size is the default 10 inches, the total window runs
 from  0.8  inches to 4.8 inches.  since the window is positive, the
 actual window area is reduced to make room for labels.  the  actual
 plot area would be approximately 1.6 inches to 4.3 inches.  
      td:[4mset window y 1.2 of -2.5[0m 
 divides  y  in  the  same  fashion as above, except that the actual
 window occupies the entire specified  area  from  y=0.8  inches  to
 y=4.8 inches.  if a second window is then specified:  
      td:[4mset window y=2.2[0m 
 it  is  adjacent  to  the first one, with the top axes of the first
 window in the same location  as  the  bottom  axes  of  the  second
 window.  
5 level
 inside,ouside,  or  level=n  sets the window level.  levels may range
 from 1 to 4.  inside increases the level by 1 and  outside  decreases
 the level by 1.  using this option you may inset windows inside other
 windows.  when you increase the level by 1 the current window is used
 to  set the maximum limits of the new window.  you may increase level
 by 1 or decrease it to any number from 1 to the current level.   when
 you  increase the level, you have effectively decreased the plot size
 to the current window size.  

                                example
 as  an  example  you  wish  to  create  a set of six windows within a
 definite location.  
      td:[4mset window x from 1 to 12 y from 1 to 7[0m 
 set the outer level 
      td:[4mset window 1 of 6 inside[0m 
           or...  
      td:[4mset window 1 of 6 level=2[0m 
 now you have 6 equal size windows bounded by 1,1 and 12,7.  to return
 to having only 1 window 
      td:[4mset window level=1[0m 
                                example
      td:[4mset window x from 1 to 12 y from 5 to 7[0m 
      td:[4mset window level=2 from 1,1 to 2,2[0m 
 insets  a window within another.  the actual physical location of the
 new window is x=2 to x=3 and y=6 to y=7.  
5 labels
 normally space for labels is allocated according to the current axes,
 and label settings.  for example if you set labels left off, no space
 will  be allocated for labels on the left side, so the window will be
 larger.  if you need to have  several  plots  all  sharing  the  same
 scale,  use either negative windows or absolute windows.  for example
 2 plots which share the same x axis may be plotted.  
      td:[4mset window y 1.2 of -2.6[0m 
      td:[4mplot set=1[0m 
      td:[4mset labels bottom off[0m 
      td:[4mset window y 2.2[0m 
      td:[4mplot set=2[0m 
 only 1 bottom axes is plotted for both windows.  

 it is assumed that left or right labels will occupy 6 characters.  if
 this is incorrect you may adjust this value when you set  the  window
 with the characters parameter.  
      td:[4mset label characters=4[0m 
 allocates  only  4  characters  for  the labels.  this gives you more
 usable plotting area.  
5 examples
 assuming  you  have  a plot size of 13 by 10 you may setup 6 windows,
 and start with the window in the middle, bottom:  
      td:[4mset window 2 of 6[0m 
           or...  
      td:[4mset window x 2 of 3 y 1 of 2[0m 
 you may select the next window (right, bottom) by:  
      td:[4mset window x next[0m 
           or...  
      td:[4mset window x 3[0m 
           or...  
      td:[4mset window 3[0m 
 you may set the previous window by:  
      td:[4mset window x previous[0m 
           or...  
      td:[4mset window x 1[0m 
 you may select the last window (right, upper corner) by:  
      td:[4mset window 6[0m 
           or...  
      td:[4mset window x 3 y 2[0m 
5 3-d
 when  setting the windows for 3-d plots there is compensation for the
 viewing distance from the object if scrd is negative.  for  the  same
 distance  and  positive  scrd  a  window  which is half the size of a
 normal window will only show half of the view.   you  may  compensate
 for  this effect by changing distance or scrd.  the effect is similar
 to what you would see if you, and the window  remained  in  the  same
 position  and  only the window size changed.  the following will plot
 approximately the data with the same view.  
      td:[4mset three distance 100 scrd 50[0m 
      td:[4mset window x 1 of 1 y 1 of 1[0m 
      td:[4mhistogram[0m 
           or ...  
      td:[4mset three distance 100 scrd -50[0m 
      td:[4mset window x 1 of 2 y 1 of 2[0m 
      td:[4mhistogram[0m 
           or ...  
      td:[4mset three distance 100 scrd 25[0m 
      td:[4mset window x 1 of 2 y 1 of 2[0m 
      td:[4mhistogram[0m 

 the  following  will  show  a  similar  view, but from a more distant
 perspective:  
      td:[4mset three distance 200 scrd 50[0m 
      td:[4mset window x 1 of 2 y 1 of 2[0m 
      td:[4mhistogram[0m 

 since  the size of 2 windows is less than half of a single window the
 example with 2 windows shows slightly less than 1 window.  
3 show

4 cursor
      [4msh[0mow [4mcu[0mrsor 

 this  puts  a  cursor  on  the  graph.   after moving the cursor to the
 desired location, press any key.  the current location  of  the  cursor
 will  be  typed  and  entered into the journal file as a comment.  this
 does not work if the device has no cursor.  if you have not plotted any
 data this command will not work.  

 the  position of the cursor is given in both text and data units.  if a
 3-d plot is displayed, the x,y,z given  are  on  a  plane  through  the
 origin parallel to the screen.

5 limited
 limits the data shown to the specified range.  for 3-d data the limit
 on the dependent variable fully modifies the statistics.  the  actual
 data  shown  my include data outside the z limits, but the statistics
 reflects only  the  data  within  all  limits.   if  limits  are  not
 specified,    the    default    is    the    current   plot   limits.

5 lines|rows
 for 3-d plots specifies which lines or rows of the mesh data to show. 
5 output
 this  specifies  the output file for the data.  if this option is not
 used, the default is sys$output, or your terminal.  if output=none is
 specified, then there is not output.  
5 points|columns
 this  specifies  which  points to show.  for 3-d this is the range of
 column numbers.  
5 sets
 this specifies which data set to show.  
5 statistics
 the  statistics  on  the data are typed at the end of the data.  this
 includes the following:  
      1.  range of data for x and y 
      2.  sum of all y values and average y value per point.  
      3.  error  in  the  sum.   this is only produced if the y values
          have a non zero dy.  to specify errors for existing data see
          the command x.  
      4.  mean x value, and standard deviation of the mean.  
          mean=sum(x*y)/sum(y) 
          std=sqrt(sum((x-mean)*y))/sum(y) 
      5.  error  on  the  mean and standard deviation.  these are only
          produced if either dx or dy are non zero for the  data.   dy
          is  used  if available otherwise dx is used to calculate the
          error.  if the number of data points with y,dx,dy  non  zero
          is less than 3 then dx is also used to calculate the error. 
5 example
 you have entered a 3 dim array with 20 by 20 points.  x ranges from 0
 to 10, y from 100 to 200.  the  total  array  will  not  fit  on  the
 terminal screen so you show a subset of the data:

 replace the x,y, or z values by new values that give a smooth curve.  [1mthe[0m
 [1mdata is assumed to be a histogram of equally spaced bins.[0m   an  alternate
 way  of  smoothing  data  is  by  convolution.  see command convolute.  a
 convolution may be used to both smooth and "sharpen" the data.  
4 options
      1.  append  -  puts  the  smoothed  data  into  a  new  data  set.
          (default:off) 
      2.  average - modifies flat.  when average=off each channel is the
          sum of n adjacent channels.  (default:on) 
      3.  check  -  checks  the  data to see if it is a proper histogram
          with x or x/y for mesh equally spaced.  if it is not an  error
          message is issued,and no smoothing is done.  (default:on) 
      4.  error  -  modifies the errors on the data assuming statistical
          errors.  if off the errors are not modified.  essentially  the
          smoothing  algorithm  is  used  on  the  square of the errors.
          (default:off) 
      5.  flat - smooths the data by adding together and averaging every
          n points.  the result has every n points  identical.   level=n
          selects the number of points.  for example smooth flat level=2
          averages points 1+2, 3+4, 5+6...  (default:off) 
      6.  level=n - selects approximately the number of points on either
          side of the bin that are used in  determining  the  value  for
          that  bin.  the range of levels is 1 to 5.  1 will smooth over
          3 points, while 5 will smooth over 11 points.  (default:3) 
      7.  lines/rows - selects which rows of a mesh are smoothed.  
      8.  limited - selects the range of x,y,z values to smooth.  
      9.  log - logs or types the results on your terminal.  
     10.  monitor - histograms the original data and joins the result.  
          see:  set mode monitor 
          the  result  is  joined  using  the  secondary attributes.  to
          change them use the set secondary command.  
     11.  name - selects the name of the appended data set 
     12.  points/columns  -  selects  which  data points or columns of a
          mesh are smoothed.  if omitted all are smoothed.  
     13.  select - selects the data set by name 
     14.  sets - selects which data sets to use.  
     15.  x,y,z...  selects whether x, y, or z values are replaced.  for
          mesh data it selects the axis to smooth along.  (default:y) 

4 algorithm
 the  data  is  smoothed  by  repeatedly  transforming  the  points  and
 residuals, using running means, quadratic interpolation,  and  hanning.
 similar algorithms are described in [4mexploratory data analysis[0m by john w
 tukey at slac.  this has been modified slightly by j.  clement to treat
 sparse statistical data correctly.  the original alogorithm would throw
 away isolated data points which were larger than the surrounding data.

 sorts  the  data  according to the order of the fields (x,y...) selected.
 if fields are omitted  then  they  are  sorted  according  to  the  order
 symbol,x,dx,y,dy,z,dz.  each data set is sorted independently.  

                                  example
      td:[4msort x y z symbol[0m 
 sorts  data  so  that  all low x are first.  within groups of identical x
 values all low y values are first, and so on.  since dx,dy,dz are omitted
 the actual sorting order is:  x,y,z,symbol,dx,dy,dz.  
3 spawn
 this  command  temporarily  spawns  out  of  topdrawer to vms.  the spawn
 command is not journaled unless abort=off mode is selected.  
      [4msp[0mawn [dcl_command] 

 for  example  you  are  trying  to  do a plot, but you have forgotten the
 filename with the topdrawer source, so you:  
      td:[4mspawn  directory[0m you will get a directory listing so you can find
 the file name.  

 if  you use the spawn command with no parameters, you return to topdrawer
 with the vms command:

 topdrawer.  any data remaining in the buffers is flushed, and all  output
 files are closed.  
 this is also equivalent to typing ctrl_z if ctrl_z is on.  

 the  program  is stopped and the string is typed.  if you wish to stop in
 the middle type ctrl_c.   this  will  abort  the  current  operation  and
 restore  the  prompt.   if  you  are in the middle of getting data from a
 file, the file will skip to the next clear  or  stop  command.   pressing
 ctrl_c  twice  rapidly  in  succession will abort all file input.  if you
 type ctrl_c twice rapidly again you will  be  prompted  if  you  wish  to
 terminate the program completely.

 this  command swaps the data for 2 variables.  if error is specified then
 the corresponding errors are swapped with the data.  this  is  useful  if
 the  data in in the wrong location for the type of plot you wish to make.
 an example of this is making 3-d plots from binned data.  you  have  read
 in  data,  x,y,dy  and  you  have binned it into a frequency distribution
 using the bin command.  now the result is in x,y,dx,dy.  you wish to make
 a 3-d histogram, but the data must be in x,z,dx,dz.  to fix the problem: 
      td:[4mswap z with y[0m 
      td:[4mswap dz with dy[0m 
 now you can set the y value and perform the histogram.  
      td:[4my=10.0[0m 
      td:[4mset three on[0m 
      td:[4mhistogram[0m

 the text will be written on the plot.  it must be enclosed in apostrophes
 or quotes.  
4 xyz
 x,  y, z - specify the position of left most character in the text.  if
 no position is given, and top,bottom...  are not specified the title is
 placed  below  the  most  recent title.  cursor produces the cross hair
 curson on interactive terminals.  you move the cursor to  the  location
 you wish the title to appear, and press the space bar.  the position of
 the cursor is written to the journal file so you may  repeat  the  plot
 exactly.   if  you  need  titles  at  angles other than horizontal, you
 should also use the option angle=n.  
4 angle
 angle=n  -  gives  the  angle  in  degrees  measured  counterclockwise.
 angle=90 runs the title from bottom to top.   this  has  no  effect  on
 perspective labels for 3-d plots.  
4 ljustify|center|rjustify
 either left, right or center justifies the title.  (default:ljustify) 
   [1m*[0m  ljustify - the center of the first character is at x,y,z.  
   [1m*[0m  center  -  the  center  of  the string is at x,y,x.  the center is
      assumed half way between the first and last characters.  
   [1m*[0m  rjustify - the center of the last character is at x,y,z.  
 if  top,bottom...   are  specified  then  the  title  is  automatically
 centered.  

                                 example
      td:[4mtitle top ljust 'left'[0m 
      td:[4mtitle top 'center'[0m 
      td:[4mtitle top rjust 'right'[0m 
 puts 3 titles at the top of the plot on the left,center, and right.  

                                 example
      td:[4mtitle 10,5 rjust 'location 10,5 -->+'[0m 
 puts the title with the plus sign at x=10, y=5.  
4 data|xdata|ydata|text
 specifies  the data or text coordinate frame.  normally x, y are in the
 text coordinate system.  if you specify x,y, and z then the data  frame
 is assumed.  
 data - both x,y are in the data frame.  
 text - both x,y are in the text frame.  
 xdata - x is in data frame y in text frame.  
 ydata - y is in data frame x in text frame.  
4 digits
 digits=n  selects  the  number  of significant figures to reproduce for
 lexicals.  if n is omitted it is assumed to be 4.  you may also set the
 number of digits with the set digits command.  

                                 example
      td:[4mtitle top 'mean=',digits=6,t_mean,' err=',digits=2,t_emean[0m 
 the top title will be the mean and error for the data.  
4 lexicals
 you  may  include a lexical value in your title.  a title lexical is an
 option in the form t_xxxx, where xxxx is the value to plot.  the number
 of  significant digits in the number is normally 4.  you may alter this
 with the digits=n option or the set digits command.   for  example  you
 wish to show the sum of the data in the top title:  
      td:[4mtitle top 'my data - sum=',t_sum[0m 
 you may wish to limit the sum to a portion of the data so you first use
 show data to calculate the sum for a limited portion, then  put  it  in
 the title:  
      [4mtd show data limited from x=5 to x=10[0m 
      td:[4mtitle bottom 'sum=' t_sum 'x from ' t_xmin ' to ' t_xmax[0m 

      td:[4mtitle top 'sum=' t_sum ' '+' case'm' t_esum[0m 
 for more information see:topdrawer lexicals.  
4 time
 inserts the current date and time into the title.  for example:  
      td:[4mtitle top '(date:  ' time ')'[0m 
 assuming  the  current  time  is noon on the jan 1, 1987, the following
 title is plotted at the top:  
      (date: 1-jan-87 12:00:00) 
4 top|bottom|right|left|general
 top,bottom,right,left - specify the title position relative to the data
 window.  general is a synonym for top.  the title is  centered  at  the
 appropriate  position.   the  size  and angle are determined by the set
 size command.  if a size, or x,y,z are  specified,  they  override  the
 default  position  and  size.   a  top  title  is  generally drawn with
 character size  1.5  times  the  default.   if  no  other  options  are
 specified, then the character size is reduced by up to a factor of 4 to
 keep the title from overflowing the screen.  
4 x|y|z
 for  3-d  plots  the  label  is  drawn  in  perspective parallel to the
 selected axis.  for 2-d plots x,y,z are synonyms for left,bottom,top.  
4 lines
 lines=n  -  moves  the  title  up space for n extra lines of text.  the
 title is moved up by n-1 lines.  if lines=1 then the title is not moved
 at all.  
4 size
 size=n  gives  the  approximate spacing between chars.  in tenths of an
 inch.   if  n  is  negative  hardware  characters  will  be  used  when
 available.   if  n is positive software characters will be used if mode
 vector=on.  if not specified the size is determined by the most  recent
 title  command.   once  this parameter has been set, the character size
 remains the same unless a bottom,top,right,left,x,y,z or size option is
 used.   if  not  specified  the  angle is determined by the most recent
 title command.  
4 index
 index=n - specifies the line spacing in multiples of character spacing.
 this is used for multiline titles.  
4 spaces
 spaces=n  this  specifies  how  much space the title occupies.  this is
 only necessary if variable character spacing, or  sub/superscripts  are
 used and you wish to center the title.  
4 intensity
 intensity - determines the intensity or line width of the title.  
4 white...
 white....  determines the color of the title.  
4 case
 controls  the  format  of the title.  it must be the next command after
 the title or more command or on the same line with the  title  command.
 it  modifies only the preceding string.  it must immediately follow the
 string either on the same, or the next line.  

      [4mca[0mse 'case_text' 

 this  specifies  the  case  or  character type of each character in the
 title text.  for the definitions of all possible case characters see:  
      topdrawer fonts 

 it  is  not  necessary to use a case command if you only want upper and
 lower case ascii characters.  simply type them into your title  as  you
 wish to see them.  

                                 example
      td:[4mtitle top 'abg' case 'ggg'[0m 
 produces a title with 3 lower case greek letters alpha,beta,gamma.  
      td:[4mtitle top 'abc' 'abg' case 'ggg'[0m 
 produces a title with 3 roman letters followed by 3 greek letters.  
      td:[4mtitle top 's=' case 'g' v_sum[0m 
 produces a greek "sigma".  
      td:[4mtitle top 's=' v_sum case 'g'[0m 
 does not produce any greek because the case and string are separated by
 a lexical.  
4 3-d
 if  the  options  x,y,  or  z  are  used,  then the title is plotted in
 perspective relative to the default x,y,z axis.  if you set  each  axis
 to  be  in  a  particular location, then you should plot the axis title
 specifying x,y,z or specify the origin  using  the  set three  command.
 the  title  starts  at the origin of the axis.  if the option center is
 used the title is centered along the axis.  

 if  the  title  position  is  also specified, then the title is plotted
 according to the position specified.  

 the  axis  angle  determines  the  orientation  of  the title.  see the
 command set three.  

 if  a  title is drawn in perspective, subsequent title commands without
 any position specifications will draw more titles above  or  below  the
 first one.  the displacement is picked away from the axis.  
4 consecutive_titles
 if a title command omits the options top, bottom, right, left, x, y, or
 z and no locations (x,y,z) are specified,  then  the  title  is  placed
 under the previous one.  the spacing is determined by the index option.
 the previous index, angle, size, justification, lines, and spacing  are
 retained.  if the previous title was a 3-d title then the current title
 may be placed above it, depending on the axes angle and orientation  of
 the view.

 the  specified  points  are  appended to last data set.  if you wish to
 create a new set you should use the data set command.  this option  may
 not  be  used  with the sets or points options.  it is also illegal for
 mesh data.  along with  append  you  must  specify  3  of  the  options
 from,to,by,n.  
4 bins|values
      bins
 creates  values  at  the  centers  of bins whose edge is defined by the
 values.  
      values
 specifies  the  values  for the specified coordinate.  if you specify a
 range of values or  bins,  you  may  not  specify  operations  such  as
 times,divide,minus,plus  or  a  coordinate  such  as  x,y,dx...   or an
 equation.  if you generate a new data set you must  specify  3  numbers
 for  from,to,by,  and  n.   if  you  modify an existing data set only 2
 numbers are spcified.  you may also specify a single value.

4 error
 this  specifies  the error on the value you have specified.  if you use
 noerror the error analysis is turned off.  this only works when you are
 modifying  x,y,z  values.   the  specified  error is used to modify the
 dx,dy,dz value.  
                                 example
      y=y * 5.0 
 will multiply each y and dy value by 5.0.  
      y=y * 5.0 error=0.1 
 will  multiply  each y and dy value by 5.0.  the specified error of 0.1
 will be used to compute the actual dy value.  
      y=y * 5.0 noerror 
 will  multiply  each  y  value  by  5.0.   the  dy  values  will remain
 unchanged.  
      y="log(yv)" noerror 
 will  take  the  log  to  base  10 of each y value.  the dy values will
 remain unchanged.  
      y="log(yv)" 
 will  take  the  log to base 10 of each y value.  the dy values will be
 modified as:  dy=abs(log(y+dy)-log(y)).  
4 expression
 you may use an expression inside quotes to actually calculate the value
 for an existing data set.  the expression is evaluated for  each  value
 required.  the lexicals v_xvalue,v_dxvalue,v_zvalue...  are the current
 x,dx,y...  needed to perform the calculation.  if you  do  not  specify
 noerror  then the error is also computed when x,y,z are modified by the
 expression.  if you use an expression you may not use any other options
 except for points, lines, columns, sets, and log and error.  

                                 example
      td:[4mx from 0 to 360 by 5[0m 
      td:[4my="sine<xv>"[0m 
 generates a sine wave between 0 and 360 degrees in 5 degree steps.  
      td:[4my=y times 10[0m 
 or...  
      td:[4my="yv*10"[0m 
 both  multiply  y  by  the  constant  value  10.0.  the first method is
 faster, and it also multiplies dy by the constant, while the expression
 does not alter dy.  
4 lines|rows
 selects  the  mesh  rows  for  which values are generated.  if a single
 number is specified it is the row number to set.  if both n1 and n2 are
 specified they are the first and last row to set.  
4 log
 types on your terminal the results of the operation.  (default:log=off) 
4 name
 the  new  set  will  usually have a name consisting of a transformation
 name followed by the old set name.  if you specify a  new  name  it  is
 applied to the new data set.  if the name ends in "%" then the old name
 is appended to the new name.  see option:append 
4 points|columns
 selects the points or mesh data columns for which values are generated.
 if a single number is specified it is point number to set.  if both  n1
 and n2 are specified they are the first and last point to set.  
4 poisson|sqrt
 applies  only to dn and makes dn=sqrt(n).  this is counting statistics.
 it is a special case of binomial  statistics  for  a  large  number  of
 samples.  
4 samples
      samples=s      applies      binomial     statistics     to     dn,
 dn=sqrt(max(n,1)*max(s-n,1)/s).  you must supply the number of  samples
 (s).   if  you generate a set of data by a monte-carlo method where the
 total number of hits s is selected, but the distribution of the hits is
 generated by the program then you should use binomial statistics.  
4 sets
 selects the data set to modify.  
4 times
 multiplies  the  selected coordinate by the selected value.  if you are
 multiplying x,y, or  z  by  a  constant  the  dx,dy,  or  dz  are  also
 multiplied  by  the  constant.  in addition if error was specified then
 the   final   dn   will   be   modified   by   the   specified   error.
 dy=sqrt(dy**2+(e*n/c)**2)*c where c is the specified constant.  
                                 example
 to multiply y by 2+-0.1 
      y=y times 2 error=.1 
           or...  
      y=y * 2 error=.1 
4 plus
 adds  the  value  to  the coordinate.  if you specify error and you are
 adding a constant to x,y, or z the dx,dy,  or  dz  are  also  modified.
 dy=sqrt(dy**2+(e)**2) where e is the specified error.  
                                 example
 to add 2+-0.1 to y 
      y=y plus 2 error=.1 
           or...  
      y=y + 2 error=.1 
4 minus
 subtracts  the  value  from the coordinate if you specify error and you
 are subtracting a constant to x,y, or z  the  dx,dy,  or  dz  are  also
 modified.  dy=sqrt(dy**2+(e)**2) where e is the specified error.  
                                 example
 to subtract 2+-0.1 from y 
      y=y minus 2 error=.1 
           or...  
      y=y - 2 error=.1 
4 divide
 divides  the coordinate by the value if you are dividing x,y, or z by a
 constant the dx,dy, or  dz  are  also  divided  by  the  constant.   in
 addition  if  error was specified then the final dn will be modified by
 the  specified  error.   dy=sqrt(dy**2+(e*n/c)**2)/c  where  c  is  the
 specified constant.  
                                 example
 to divide y by 2+-0.1 
      y=y divide 2 error=.1 
           or...  
      y=y / 2 error=.1 
4 warning
 if  you have already plotted the current data, this command will delete
 it if just a value, or range of values is specified for x,y, or z.   if
 you  wish  to keep the data, you should use the option points, sets, or
 append.

2 lexical_values
 you  have access to data via lexicals.  for example you may access the sum,
 mean, standard deviation of your data  set  and  put  them  into  a  title.
 see:command title.   quantities such as points, sum etc.  are calculated by
 a set statistics or show data command.  if you do not use set statistics or
 show  data  to  generate  them,  they are automatically calculated from the
 entire data set.  whenever you modify  the  data  set,  you  must  use  set
 statistics to set the statistics if you wish the lexicals to represent only
 a subset of the data.  to use a lexical value you must use a symbol of  the
 form:  t_name, s_name, or v_name.  the t_name inserts the value of the name
 into a title string.  v_name or <name> is  used  to  get  the  value  as  a
 number.  s_name gets a value as a string.  you may define lexical values by
 the command define value or define string.  

 the  lexicals  may  be  abbreviated  to  the  shortest  unique  name.   for
 convenience v_ may be omitted inside an expression.  this will increase the
 time  to  parse  an  expression.   for  example  <v_xvalue>  is the same as
 <xvalue> or v_xv.

3 values
 v_xvalue[n,ns]  is the n'th value in set ns.  likewise v_dxvalue[n,ns] is
 the n'th  value  in  set  ns.   you  may  also  access  y,dy,z,  and  dz.
 s_symbol[n,ns]  is the symbol for the the n'th value in set ns.  if ns is
 omited then n is the point number.  

 for  mesh  plots  v_xvalue[n1],v_yvalue[n2],v_zvalue[n1,n2]  are  used to
 access the data point values where n1 is the column number and n2 is  the
 row number.  

 if  both  n and ns are omitted then it is the value for the current point
 in an x=,dx=,y=...  command.  
3 repeat
      [4mv_rep[0meat[n] 
 this  is  the  repeat  index  for repeat commands.  it starts at 1 and is
 equal to the number of repeats when the loop terminates.  you may specify
 the  loop number as n.  if n is omitted it is the current inner loop.  if
 n is negative it is the next outer loop.

2 subroutines
 the topdrawer package is available as a collection of subroutines.  you can
 call them to produce plots from any program.  each subroutine is  the  same
 as giving a topdrawer command.  they are available in library 
                           topdrawer_dir:topdrawer
3 names
 most  internal  subroutines used by topdrawer begin with t1,t2,td, or tx.
 the unified graphics routines all begin with ug.  the exceptions to these
 rules  except  for token are documented here.  the cern library histogram
 routines used by td do not follow any clear conventions.

      literals,  or  character variables sent by reference when using
      those routines.  


 if  you use a byte array or a character array sent by reference, you must
 terminate it with a semicolon (;) the following are all legal:

3 linking
 for  more  information on linking see ugs.  the following routines should
 be linked to your program.  
      $ link routine, - 
           topdrawer_dir:topdrawer[/include=td]/library, - 
           packlib_olb/library,mathlib_olb/library, 
           ugs_dir:objlib/library 

 if you wish to link a standalone version of topdrawer use /include=td.  

 for  example  you  wish to make up a version of topdrawer to do fits with
 your own supplied function tdufun.  you  would  link  a  new  version  as
 follows:  
      $ link tdufun, - 
           topdrawer_dir:topdrawer/include=td/library, - 
           packlib_olb/library,mathlib_olb/library, 
           ugs_dir:objlib/library 

3 demo_program
 there  are  demo programs in topdrawer_root:[examples] called td_demo.for
 and td_demo3.for , with a command file to build them called  td_demo.com.

3 cputim
 time = cputim(otime) 

      this  call  will  give  you  the  difference  in cputime between the
 current time and the previous time (otime) in seconds.  if otime=0.0 then
 the total cpu time since the start of your process is returned.  

 this subroutine is independent from the rest of topdrawer 
3 cpulim
 time = cpulim(otime) 

      this  call  will  give  you  the  difference  in cputime between the
 remaining cpu  time  and  the  previous  time  (otime)  in  seconds.   if
 otime=0.0  then  the  total time limit since the start of your process is
 returned.  if cpulim(0.0) is zero then there is no  time  limit  on  your
 process.  

                                  example
      time=cpulim(cputim(0.0)) 
 this  gives  you the time remaining.  if this is negative, then there was
 no limit.  

 this subroutine is independent from the rest of topdrawer 
3 help
      call help(string) 
 input:  
      string = string of arguments to pass to help 
 this  program  was  copied  from  fortran users guide d-16 it assumes the
 primary help library is hlp$library.  

 this subroutine is independent from the rest of topdrawer 
3 intrac
      itest=intrac(i) 
 i - a dummy variable 
 itest = .true.  if you are running interactively.  
3 spawn
      call spawn('command line') 
 a  subprocess  is created, the command line is executed, and then control
 returns to your program.  if the command line is blank, the user gets the
 dcl prompt, and control returns after the user types log.  
3 trace
      call trace 

 generates  an  error message including traceback.  this may be useful for
 debugging.  
3 readpr
 this reads from the sys$input after prompting 
      call readpr('prompt',string,length,[itimeout]) 

 input:  
      prompt= string to prompt with 
      itimeout=  timeout  time  in  seconds  (integer) if the time between
 typed characters exceeds the timeout then the read is terminated.  
 output:  
      string = input 
      length = length of the input 

 you  may  define keypad keys to return a string using defkey.  defkey and
 readpr are routines which work together.  

 this subroutine is independent from the rest of topdrawer 

                                  example
      character*20 str 
      call readpr('input:',str,i,60) 
      if (i.gt.0) type *,'str=",str(1:i),'"' 
 reads  a  string of 20 characters or less and writes it on your terminal.
 you have 60 seconds to begin typing after the prompt.  
3 defkey
 this defines a key on the keypad.  
      call defkey(string) 

 the  keypad  key  is  defined  in  a manner similar to the define/key vms
 command.  all of the ask routines and readpr will  interpret  the  keypad
 keys,  according  to  the defkey routine.  defkey and readpr are routines
 which work together.  

                                  example
      call defkey('/key pf2 "help"/terminate') 
 this is the default definition of pf2 
3 tdarro

      call tdarro(xyz,[dxyz,[imode,[itype]]]) 
      1.  xyz(3,2)  is the array of xyz to specify the arrow.  xyz(*,1) is
          the tail while xyz(*,2) is the head.  for 2-d plots the z  value
          is ignored.  
      2.  dxyz(4) specifies the offsets and size.  
          a.  dxyz(1) - the offset for the tail of arrow 
          b.  dxyz(2) - the offset for the head of the arrow 
          c.  dxyz(3) - size of arrow if zero the default is used.  
          d.  dxyz(4) - flare of arrow if zero the default is used.  
      3.  imode(2)  - specifies the frame.  data=0, text=1 imode(1) is for
          tail of arrow.  
      4.  itype - specifies the texture,color,intensity 
 for  more  information  see  topdrawer command arrow.  this is similar to
 giving the command.  
      td:[4marrow    from    xyz(1,1),xyz(2,1),xyz(3,1)   less   dxyz(1)   to[0m
 [4mxyz(1,2),xyz(2,2),xyz(3,2)  less  dxyz(2)  size=dxyz(3),dxyz(4)[0m   outputs
 extended titles with case formatting.  
 [1mthis  routine  is not recommended[0m.  it is provided for compatability with
 older versions of topdrawer.  use tdtext instead.  
      call tdcase('title','case'[,x,y]) 
      call tdcase('title','case','position') 
      call tdcase('title') 

 see tdtitl for more information 
3 tdcrcl
 this draws either a box, diamond, or ellipse.  
      call tdcrcl(xy,dxy,itype,[idata,[mode[,angles]]]);  
      1.  xy(3) is the array of xyz to specify the center of the figure.  
      2.  dxy(3) is the array of xyz to specify the width of the figure.  
      3.  itype 
                 1        2       3
               box  diamond ellipse
      4.  idata 
               0 - xyz specified in text coordinates 
               1 - center in data, width in text coordinates.  
               3 - both center and width are in data coordinates.  
      5.  mode      -     specifies     texture,     intensity,     color.
          see:subroutine tdhist.  
      6.  angles(2) - range of angles for circle 

                                  example
      real xy(3),dxy(3) 
      data xy/1.,1.,1./,dxy/.5,.5,.5/ 
      call tdcrcl(xy,dxy,3,3) 
 draws an ellipse centered at 1,1,1 of size 0.5 in the data frame.  
3 tdend
 this  subroutine  ends  the  graphics  and closes any output files.  this
 should not be used to end an individual plot of a series.  it only  needs
 to be called once before exiting from your program.  
3 tdflsh
 normally  the graphics buffer is flushed after the subroutine call unless
 flush is set off.  tdflsh will allow you to flush the buffers  only  when
 desired.  this is much faster than flushing automatically.  
3 tdgetv
      logical l 
      l=tdgetv('string',value) 
 input:  
      string         = the name of the lexical to get 
 output:  
      value          = the actual value returned 
      l    = .true.  if the lexical was found, .false.  if not found.  

                                  example

          of normal ascii characters 
      4.  x,y,z  -  specify  the  title  position in text coordinates.  if
          omitted and no options  are  specified,  the  current  title  is
          placed under the last.  

 this  is  a  fortran-77  compatible subroutine.  [1mdo not use %ref[0m with the

3 tdvax_plot
      call tdvax_plot 
 this  will  set  up  your  terminal  as  the default device, provided the
 logical name plot_term is correctly set.  normally it is set when you log
 in so you usually do not need to worry about it.  

 if this routine is not called, you must call tdset and specify the device
 to use in plotting.  
3 t2curs
      call t2curs(i,xyz,xyz1,xyz2,lf1,lf2);  
 this subroutine returns both text and data coordinates from the cursor:  
      1.  i = character typed ichar(character) (if 0 no input) 
      2.  xyz(2) = physical device coordinates.  
      3.  xyz1(2) = text coordinates.  
      4.  xyz2(3) = data coordinates.  if the plot is 2-d xyz2(3)=0 
      5.  lf1 = .true.  if text coor.  returned 
      6.  lf2 = .true.  if data coor.  returned 
3 t2main
      call t2main(iarg,string) 

 this calls the topdrawer main program.  
      input:  string 
 this  is a command to perform.  if it is blank then topdrawer will prompt
 you until either a return,stop, or new plot command is typed.  
      output:  iarg 
           = 1 if a clear command was typed.  
           = 2 if a stop command was typed.  


                                   note

      this  subroutine calls all other topdrawer subroutines.  if you
      call it then all other subroutines will  be  included  in  your
      program.  


3 t2upcs
      call t2upcs(str) 

 converts a character string to upper case.  
3 t2sqez
      call t2sqez(str,ilen) 

 squeezes  out  multiple  blanks from str, and returns the location of the
 last non blank character in ilen.  
3 t2_trap

 traps  any  control  c interrupts.  while executing topdrawer subroutines
 this returns control back to t2main or the user routine.  
2 linking
 if  you  wish to link a program so that it may share hbook4 histograms with
 topdrawer, you need to do the following:  

      1.  insert the following lines of code into your main program.  
               integer hcreateg 
               parameter ihsize=100000 
               common /pawc/memory(ihsize) 
                    ......  
               istat=hcreateg('region_name',memory,ihsize) 
               if (istat .le.  0) stop 'can not create region' 
               call hlimit(ihsize) 
          you may adjust the ihsize to the proper value.  

      2.  when you link you must also include:  
               topdrawer_dir:td_group/opt 
          to give users in your group only read access to your histograms.  
               istat=hcreateg('region_name',memory,-ihsize) 
                    or link using....  
               topdrawer_dir:td/opt 
          td_group  uses  a  modified  version  of  hcreateg rather than the
          standard cern version.  the modified one in addition to setting up
          group  read/write protection on the section also prevents creation
          of the same global section by more than 1 person.   it  creates  a
          new  version  instead.   it  will type out the name of the created
          global section.  the modified version  will  create  a  read  only
          section if -ihsize is passed to it.  

          to create a global section hcreateg must open a scratch file.  the
          modified  version  attempts  to  do  this  on  sys$scratch:.    by
          reassigning  the  scratch  device  you may put this file on a disk
          with enough quota.  
               $ define sys$scratch usr$scratch:[name]

                                 j.  clement
 all syntax has been "regularized" and extended for convenience.  
3 obsolete_commands
 most  commands  in  the "original" version still work.  there are the few
 known exceptions.  
      1.  dump - removed 
      2.  set file debug - removed 
      3.  set file error - removed 
      4.  set  file input n - no longer works the same.  instead of a unit
          number you must specify a file name.  
      5.  set file output n - no longer works the same.  instead of a unit
          number you must specify a file name.  
      6.  time - replaced by show time.  
      7.  set device 4013 - removed.  
      8.  certain undocumented commands were removed.  specifically in the
          original version the option set may be omitted entirely, but  it
          must be used in the bonner lab version for set commands.  
3 86
      1.  set color - now accepts full range of ugsys color specs.  
      2.  set  file  -  command rewritten.  it now accepts a file name and
          multiple nesting of set file input is possible.  
      3.  unit numbers modified to allow batch input.  
      4.  set  device  ddname=filename  -  the  limitation  of  8 chars on
          filename is removed.  
      5.  set device - interactive is the default.  
      6.  help - new command added.  
      7.  added prompting for interactive input.  
      8.  plot_term,  plot_device  logical  names  are  used  to determine
          default device.  
      9.  token - tabs are treated as spaces.  
     10.  sixels is now a legal device.  
     11.  set input is a synonym of set card.  
     12.  set errors - new command added.  
     13.  fixed set device command so sideways works properly.  
     14.  intensity/width  3  did not work properly, and would cause other
          options to work improperly.  
     15.  set device accepts lowercase chars.  in string.  
     16.  set structure can now set funny.  
     17.  histogram command now produces a block plot for 3-d data.  
     18.  flush command flushes the buffers.  
     19.  fixed ug errors when no plot make.  
     20.  fixed  failure  to  set  device  in the middle of an interactive
          session.  
     21.  added journal file and set journal command.  
     22.  added show commands as mirror to set commands.  
     23.  rewrote  t23hst  to  add  fast  "lego"  plots as well as minimal
          histograms.  
     24.  title  x|y|z  now  produces titles next to 3-d axes.  the lables
          and titles are always  drawn  on  the  outer  side  of  axes  by
          default.  
     25.  t23hst,t23jin  accept  a  texture  parameter.   t23hst  may plot
          hidden lines with the option hide.  
     26.  t2freq  modified  for  incomplete  storage.   now  only  x,y are
          required.  
     27.  modified  txdot  and  txtsym  to  produce  points  directly from
          unified graphics.  this makes better points  for  hi  resolution
          displays, and faster points on tek4010 displays.  
     28.  t23plt - added to do scatter plots.  
     29.  slice - command added to plot slices of mesh data.  
     30.  fixed t2def2 so limits are properly defined at all times.  
     31.  added  set  hist  command.   this  is  conditionalized for the 3
          different types of hist routines.  you can get rice format,  and
          hbook format hist files to be displayed by topdrawer.  
     32.  show  data  can show you a subset of the data, with calculations
          of statistics on the data.  
     33.  3d is now properly selected for each type of hist.  
     34.  define key - defines keypad keys for ansii terminals.  
     35.  the  previous 20 input lines are stored for recall by ansii mode
          terms.  this is done using smg routines so foreign terminals can
          be defined also.  
     36.  traceback for input files has been added.  
     37.  modified  txline  for  optimized  point  plotting.   essentially
          drawing points with ugmark is faster for  some  protocalls  than
          drawing  zero length lines.  this is automatically done wherever
          possible.  this is especially true for 4010 graphics.  a cluster
          of nearby dots can save a factor of 3 in transfer time.  
     38.  regularized   the   error   messages,  and  added  messages  for
          pen,width,card length out of range.  
     39.  added permanent option to set symbol,grid,width this changed the
          logic of set symbol slightly to conform to other commands.  
     40.  the  card length was changed to conform to standard screen sizes
          (80 cols).  the format string  is  (256a1)  to  make  card  size
          changes easy.  
     41.  fixed automatic flush so it works properly for interactive use. 
     42.  fixed  novector mode so that it works.  make the default vector.
          removed  '$'  as  a  separator.   this  is  necessary  for  some
          filenames!  (txxug77) 
     43.  29-oct-1986     -     added     dsize,dots,...     options    to
          circl,ellipse,diamond,box commands.  (t2main,t2plot) 
     44.  31-oct-1986         -         added        cursor        support
          (t2xfrm,txxug77,t2set1,t2show).  
     45.  5-nov-1986 - fixed the option plot symbol so it works, and fixed
          problem with multiple options after plot.  
     46.  added  color,texture,intensity  control  to  set  axes, outline,
          grid, title.  also color, texture may now be  specifed  for  any
          command that draws something.  plot, hist, box, title....  
     47.  added  support  for  multiple data sets.  option sets picks data
          sets.  
     48.  added mesh data support to smooth command.  
     49.  14-nov-1986  -  fixed  bug  in  t2rdpt.  data after a symbol was
          skipped.  
     50.  modified string handling to fortran-77.  
     51.  26-nov-1986 - added if,else,endif.  
     52.  1-dec-1986  -  added  options scale, ticks, and permanent to set
          scale command.  added option permanent to set  color  and  reset
          color  with  each  new  plot.   fixed a problem with join spline
          dash.  if the points were closely spaced a solid line is  drawn.
          added options blink, proportional, hardtexture.  
     53.  8-dec-1986  -  added sideways option to set size.  added options
          white,...   width=,  dotted  to  set  ticks,labels,title.   show
          command  now  shows  the  default  values as well as the current
          ones.  
     54.  16-dec-1986  -  added options dot/dash/daash/random/space to set
          pattern.  fixed infinite loop when no pattern specified.  
     55.  23-dec-1986  - added option for automatic pattern generation for
          drawing commands.  ie.  join dot dot dash generates the  pattern
          to  do  this.   added  expand  option  to join,hist,plot.  added
          variable, size, norandom options to plot.  
3 87
      1.  1-feb-1987 - typing ctrl_c will abort the current plot or print.
          the set histogram command may select histograms by substring  in
          the  title.   next|previous may be combined with name= to select
          the next hist which matches the name.  next|previous  will  wrap
          around  the  end  of  the  histogram  list  unless  wrap  off is
          specified or in batch mode.  
      2.  12-feb-1987  - the journal file will contain coordinates entered
          by  cursor.   the  autoplot  mode  was  added.   the   condition
          interactive  may  be  tested  by the if command.  margins may be
          specified in addition  to  the  screen  size  in  the  set  size
          command.  
      3.  26-feb-1987  -  added  define command and show hist may now show
          more information.  the option current has  been  added  to  show
          hist.  
      4.  10-mar-1987  -  added  option append to set hist.  added options
          points, and sets to bin.  histogramming speed was optimized  for
          cases  with  a  series  of  identical y values.  show data gives
          errors on statistics, and statistics are generated for each data
          set  separately.  fixed problem with histogramming data withou z
          values as 3-d plot.  
      5.  7-apr-1987  -  added  commands delete, fit.  fixed some problems
          with separate data sets.  
      6.  30-apr-1987  - added option add to set hist.  if a mesh was read
          with one axes increasing and the other decreasing, it would  not
          plot properly.  this has been fixed.  
      7.  8-may-1987  -  added  contour plotting, and log_error routine to
          trap arithmetic errors.   the  error  handling  returns  to  the
          t2main program.  
      8.  19-may-1987 - virtual memory added to vax version.  
      9.  5-jun-1987 - fixed hidden line algorithm.  it used wrong average
          x,y to calculate the vertical.  as a result it treated as hidden
          many lines incorrectly.  
     10.  11-jun-1987 - fixed infinite loop in t2msfv.  rewrote t2mesh for
          better hidden line removal.  the old algorithm  would  leave  in
          hidden lines, or omit visible line segments that are bisected by
          sharp peaks.  the new algorith fixes these errors with less than
          a 5% loss in cpu speed.  
     11.  17-jun-1987  - fixed problems with title overflow for small page
          sizes.  added lines parameter to set  title  and  shift  to  set
          labels.   added  numbered  windows.   negative scrd will produce
          constant view of mesh.  dot plots and mesh plots were  optimized
          for  max  speed.   essentially  the user can select windows more
          easily.  
     12.  23-jun-1987 - fixed problems with 3-d text.  the duplex font did
          not work for 3-d text, it caused  array  overflows  or  spurious
          lines.   3-d text processing was somewhat optimized.  the syntax
          of the set grid command  has  been  brought  in  line  with  set
          axes,label,title commands.  
     13.  16-jul-1987 - fixed set three to conform to documentation.  
     14.  23-jul-1987  -  modified  t2tlab so that labels may be generated
          for data with a large range.  some changes  were  also  made  in
          t2cntr.    added   table   generation  for  1/2-d  data.   limit
          generation was modified to keep  the  limits  within  reasonable
          values,  when the data has very small relative variation.  title
          generation was modified to keep long titles on the screen.   the
          character size is reduced by up to a factor of 4 if the title is
          too long to fit.  
     15.  30-jul-1987  - modified year/month scale so that all days occupy
          equal space.  
     16.  30-aug-1987 
          a.  lexicals  were  added  as  input to allow access to internal
              numbers.  
          b.  the set statistics command allows the user to set the actual
              statistical data used by the lexicals.  
          c.  set digits  determines the number of digits used for output.
              digits options in titles  allow  formatting  of  numbers  in
              titles.  
          d.  plot table - plots the data as a table of numbers.  
          e.  plot  axes/grid  -  has  options x,y,z...  to allow absolute
              user control over axes/grid generation.  
          f.  inhibit option has been added to set labels, set axes...  to
              allow inhibiting axes generation while still  leaveing  room
              for the axes.  
     17.  16-sep-1987  -  added  mesh  data handling to x,y,z commands, as
          well as minus and divide options.  multiply and divide  commands
          may  be  used  to  manipulate  histograms or spectra.  the x,y,z
          commands were modified to handle dx,dy, and dz automatically.  
     18.  14-oct-1987  - added lexicals for external histogram parameters.
          modified plot command so that the current texture applies to the
          error bars.  define value and define string commands were added.
          s_ lexicals were added for access to string lexicals.  
     19.  31-oct-1987  -  added  log  option  to bin, swap, x, smooth, set
          hist, define hist, add, multiply, and  divide  commands.   added
          set mode log for automatic logging.  added set window level=n to
          make inset windows easier.  added inside option to set labels to
          make packed windows easy to create.  

3 88
      1.  15-jan-1988  -  added  expression  parsing.   this allows you to
          enter an arithmetic expression wherever a number is called  for.
          the  syntax  is <expression>.  see topdrawer data expression for
          more details.  added repeat and endrepeat commands.  the  equals
          sign  "="  may not be replaced by a comma "," or slash "/" where
          it is used in the documentation.  it may be replaced by  spaces.
          plus,  or  minus "+-" signs are not allowed in options except as
          part of a number.  
      2.  4-feb-1988  -  added angle lexicals (view_...).  fixed some bugs
          in mesh plots.  added x="expression" command.  added create mesh
          command  to  create  mesh data sets.  modified plot variable for
          mesh data so the symbol size is automatically set to the maximum
          bin size.  
      3.  apr-1988 - fixed limited option for show data command, and added
          limited option to bin command.  added for option to wait.  added
          packed  option  to  set order.   the  set  order and set storage
          commands no longer delete  data.   the  sort  command  has  been
          added.  
      4.  jun-1988  -  fixed  the  error  calculation  on  mean  for  show
          statistics.  fixed new reset so that scales are  also  reset  to
          the original default.  
      5.  aug-1988  -  added  mesh,normal  options  to bin command.  added
          check option to  add,subtract,multiply,divide  commands.   added

          add,subtract,multiply,divide   options    to    define histogram
          commnand.   fixed  an  infinite  loop  when  a  single  point is
          histogrammed.  
      6.  nov-1988  -  added theta,phi,angle specifications to set symbol,
          and set grid.  spiffed up the show formats.  added  excl  driver
          for native mode support of talaris-1590 and ln-03+ printers.  
      7.  dec-1988  - fixed several bugs.  set window 3 of -4 did not work
          as the first window.  only 1 of 4 could be the first window.   a
          call  to  t2main  with  blank string after a call with non blank
          string  would  not  prompt  for  input.   show   window   worked
          incorrectly   for   -   windows.    calls  to  t2join,t2hist...,
          incorrectly reset permanent limits.  
      8.  dec-1988  -  added  ntfit,npfit  lexicals,  and  extended tdplt,
          t2join,t2hist for 3-d data.  
      9.  28-dec-1988              -             added             options
          area/share/save/read/write/input/output    to    set/define/show
          histogram commands.  created a compatible version with hbook4.  
3 89
      1.  jan-1989  -  fixed error calculations for fitting routines.  the
          quoted errors  were  too  large.   added  error  option  to  fit
          command.   fitted curves are generated with error bars now.  add
          fit to data set now also adds the fitted errors unless error=off
          is   specified.   fixed  equation  evaluation.   exponents  were
          evaluated incorrectly ie.  <1.0e-3>-->1000.  and <1.0e+3>-->.001 
      2.  feb-1989  -  added  file spec/list=/command=/journal= options to
          topdrawer command line.  
      3.  mar-1989 - added merge command to merge data sets.  
      4.  apr-1989 - added mixed data sets.  mesh + regular data may exist
          as separate data sets.  added error display to join command  for
          mesh  data.   add/sub/mul/div  commands  now  may add mesh data.
          added errors to mesh data.  show stat now shows mean/std...  for
          mesh data.  new options:  
               error had been added to command read mesh,join,create mesh. 
               append has been added to read mesh,create mesh 
          modified options:  
               sets,   points|columns,   lines|rows  are  now  independent
          options.  
          sets - specifies the data set only.  
          points - specifies the point/column number within the set.  
          when  the  limited  option is used, the z value is used to limit
          the data.  
          created netwindow files to use td over the decnet.  
      5.  june-1989  -  added  tek4207  support to tek driver.  speeded up
          regis/tek drivers.  added vaxstation (uguisd driver) support.  
      6.  nov-1989  - added support for ntuples to ntopdawer.  removed the
          slash as a separator.  it may be put back by the command:  
               set character separator "/" 
      7.  dec-1989   -   a  number  of  enhancements  have  been  made  to
          ntopdrawer.   added  the  options   tree   to   save/restore/set
          histogram  commands  and added support for "wild" characters for
          histogram area specification.  added the monitor histogram,  and
          delete  histogram.   removed  support  for  rice histograms from
          ntopdrawer.  added  support  for  a  global  section  containing
          hbook4 histograms.  ntopdrawer is now capable of handling hbook4
          histograms in a fairly simple fashion.  

          both  ntopdrawer  and  topdrawer  have been enhanced as follows.
          the driver for tek4010 has been modified to allow you to specify
          the necessary escape sequences for entering and exiting tek-4010
          mode as  well  as  for  reproducing  colors.   support  for  the
          lsi-7107  color terminal has been added.  support for postscript
          and am imagen printer has been added.   the  options  space  has
          been added in addition to dots,dash...  for line structure.  
3 90
      1.  jan-1990  - optimized expression evaluation to achieve a 30 fold
          speedup.  added error  handling  to  smoothing  routine.   added
          support for a postscript printer.  
      2.  feb-1990  -  added  equation  option to fit.  for general linear
          fits.  optimized the auto label generation for logarithmic axes.
          removed  restrictions  on  order of decades, subticks in the set
          scale command.  added device uis to be able to  dump  screen  of
          vaxstation  to  disk in full resolution.  made vaxstation driver
          work for  color  station.   added  color  mappings  for  decgigi
          driver.  
      3.  july-1990  - fixed project command in topdrawer.  it was correct
          in ntopdrawer.  it would sometimes give  incorrect  results  for
          hbook histograms.  
          added  options fetch and read to topdrawer command restore hist.
          (version 3.5) 

          note:   some  versions  may  have  had problems with the fitting
          lexicals.  vCoefficient...  as some modules were  compiled  with
          /gfloat  and  some  were  not.   the standard is /gFloat for all
          double precision operations if it is supported  by  the  machine
          that it is compiled on.  

          fixed lexicals v...  inside expressions.  y="vXvalue**2" yielded
          incorrect results while y="xvalue**2" was correct.  this problem
          dated from jan-1990 when optimization was introduced.  
      4.  dec-1990     -     added     options    weight,    eweight    to
          add,subtract,multiply,divide commands.  these allow weighting of
          data when doing the operation.  
3 91
      1.  jan-1991  -  added documentation to command set device on how to
          create separate plot and command windows for tek-4010 and  regis
          graphics.  
          added procedures:  freeze.top and freeze22.top to topdrawer_dir: 
      2.  18-jan-1991  - fixed bug in module txline that produced spurious
          lines by incorrect scissoring.  
      3.  added  set  cycle,  show  cycle  commands  and  cycle  option to
          contour.  
      4.  21-jan-1991 - fixed bug in plot,join,histogram commands.  slices
          did not work properly when three was off.  revision level 3.6.  

          added options offset,data,absolute,value,cursor to plot table to
          move the table to more convenient locations.  

          add option vector to plot command, to plot a vector field, where
          dx,dy,dz is the length of the vector.  
      5.  29-jan-1991  -  fixed  security  hole  to conceal passwords when
          using  files  over   decnet.    fixed   some   minor   bugs   in
          add/subtract/multiply commands.  

          add  option  vector  to  add/subtract/multiply  commands  to  do
          operations on vector fields.  
      6.  8-feb-1991  -  added  set mode check,confirm,tree.  these select
          whether checking, confirmation,  or  hbook  tree  searching  are
          defaulted   to   on.    added   options  points,rows,limited  to
          add/sub/mult/div commands this allows  compete  selection  of  a
          subset of data to operate on.  added option check to fft command
          to allow turning off data checking.  
      7.  11-feb-1991  -  fixed problem with short ticks being produced in
          set scale when option label=n preceded ticks=m.  version 3.7 
      8.  28-feb-1991 - added options fill,hide to most commands that draw
          something.  this means you  may  fill  and  hide  boxes,circles,
          diamonds,  histograms,  arrows.   in  addition the set/show fill
          commands allow you to manipulate the fill patterns.   added  the
          command  set/show  shield  to  shield  a  section of a plot from
          further plotting.  added a  gks  (dec)  for  those  devices  not
          availble  through  ugs.   fixed  a  minor bug that switched line
          texture unexpectedly in uis driver.  
      9.  4-mar-1991  -  added  set/show  units to allow you to reset both
          text and character units.  

          fixed  some  problems  with  3d histograms.  conditionalized the
          code and documentation to allow cm instead of inches throughout.
          this  means  that  the defaults are all in cm instead of inches.
          you may use these conditionals  to  build  a  completely  metric
          verstion of td.  
     10.  15-mar-1991   -   version   4.0   added  options  select="name",
          name="name" to add names to data sets.  select selects data sets
          by  name,  while  name  sets the data set name.  hbook histogram
          names are automatically propagated  to  the  data  set.   option
          title  added to join, plot, hist, contour to add title when data
          set is plotted.  
     11.  25-mar-1991  -  added  nonlinear  option to fit to use minuit to
          perform fits on nonlinear functions.  fixed problem in arbitrary
          linear fit functions.

          default the new version of topdrawer.  fixed some bugs with  set
          units.  
     14.  28-jun-1991  -  modified  the x,y,z commands so that dx,dy or dz
          are automatically recomputed when an expression is used.  
     15.  22-jul-1991  -  fixed  a  bug  in store hist command.  the wrong
          default  recl  was  used.   removed  calls  to  obsolete  hfnext
          routine.  
     16.  23-aug-1991  -  added  option mesh to fit command for mesh fits.
          added option append to list command to  append  listing  on  old
          file.  fixed error handling for minuit fits.  now the errors are
          the same for linear and nonlinear fits.  added functiond  dgauss
          and  dpoly  to  list of functions, as fits of z vs x,y.  fixed a
          bug in t2mesh that  messed  up  histograms  of  mesh  data  with
          errors.  gminut has been added to ntopdrawer.  
     17.  sept-1991  -  added  option  save to contour to save the contour
          lines in data sets.  fixed an 2 outrageous bugs in t2smooth  and
          smctrl.   one bug incorrectly treated the end points of a curve.
          the other would delete isolated data points that  were  adjacent
          to a flat region in the data.  

          added  interpolate  command  to  produce  interpolated data sets
          using local fitting procedures.  this uses the  same  procedures
          as  the  join  command.   added monitor option to bin, fit, fft,
          convolute, smooth commands to plot before/after pictures.  added
          set mode monitor/append to enable automatic monitor, append.  

          fixed  equations  inside fit command.  arbitrary equations would
          sometimes give incorrect results.  it has been fixed.  
          version 4.31 
     18.  nov-1991  -  fixed fatal error in fit that prevented producing a
          curve from set coefficients.  fixed some bugs  in  all  commands
          that use the option check.  
     19.  version 4.4 added orientation=n to set size/device commands.  
          version 4.32 
     20.  apr-1992  added  option  portrait/landscape to set device.  also
          added device eps.  
2 installation
 to install topdrawer on your system:  
      1.  copy  the  topdrawer*.exe to a suitable directory.  you may either
          put it into sys$system or any other directory  accessable  to  all
          users.  there are currently versions for topdrawer.  
          a.  topdrawer.exe - the version with hcuis, but no gks routines.  
          b.  topdrawer_nohcuis.exe  -  a  version with dummy hcuis routines
              this version should work on virtually any vax.  
          c.  topdrawer_gks  -  a  version  using  the dec gks routines, and
              dummy hcuis routines.  
               $ [4massign /system disk:[directory] topdrawer_dir[0m 
               $ [4mcopy *topdrawer*.exe topdrawer_dir:[0m  
          the assign command should be added to sys$manager:systartup.com.  
      2.  copy the sample files to topdrawer_dir:  tdintro.top, td3d etc.  
      3.  create  the  symbol  topdrawer.  this line should be placed in the
          system wide login file.  
               $ [4mtopd*rawer :== $topdrawer_dir:topdrawerxxx[0m 
          where xxx are selected for the proper version.  
      4.  insert the help into a suitable help library.  
          a.  if you wish to have it in the system help:  
                   $ [4mlibr /help sys$help:helplib topdrawer[0m 
          b.  or if you wish to have it in an auxiliary help library:  
                   $ [4mlibr /help/create user_help:userhelp topdrawer[0m 
              then make the user help library available to all users 
                   $ [4massign /system user_help:userhelp hlp$library[0m 
              this line needs to be added to sys$manager:systartup.com.  
      5.  if  you  wish  to  use this program, but you do are not the system
          manager, follow the same steps outlined above,  but  omit  /system
          from the assign command.  the symbol creation and the help library
          assignment will go in your login.com file.
