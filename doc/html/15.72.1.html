x,  y, z - Specify the position of left most character in the text.  If no
position is given, and TOP,BOTTOM...   are  not  specified  the  title  is
placed below the most recent title.  CURSOR produces the cross hair curson
on interactive terminals.  You move the cursor to the  location  you  wish
the  title to appear, and press the space bar.  The position of the cursor
is written to the JOURNAL file so you may repeat the plot exactly.  If you
need  titles  at  angles  other  than  horizontal, you should also use the
option ANGLE=n.
