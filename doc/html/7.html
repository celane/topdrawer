Normally  TOPDRAWER  gets  primary input from either a batch file, or your
terminal (SYS$INPUT).  You may have secondary input  files  by  using  the
command:
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>FILE</U> <U>INPUT</U> <U>filename</U>

If you run TOPDRAWER interactively, but from an indirect command file, the
input will be from the file that invoked TOPDRAWER.  If you wish  to  have
input from the terminal, you may assign TT:  to SYS$INPUT temporarily by:
     $ <U>ASSIGN</U> <U>/USER</U> <U>TT:</U>  <U>SYS$INPUT</U>
     $ <U>TOPDRAWER</U>

You  should  not  do  this in BATCH, as TT:  is the default output for the
graphics.  You may get data  from  output  files  generated  by  histogram
packages.  For more information on this see:Command SET HISTOGRAM.

Some input may be made via the cross hair cursor.  For example SHOW CURSOR
brings  up  the  cursor on your terminal.  Move the cursor to the location
you desire, and press any key except "Return" The current location of  the
cursor will be typed and entered into the journal file as a comment.  Some
other commands that use the cursor are ARROW, BOX, CIRCLE, ELLIPSE, TITLE,
SET WINDOW, and SET LIMITS.

The  input  string  may not be longer than 256 characters.  If you need to
omit columns or set up a special format for the  commands:   SET CARD  and
SET FORMAT.

For more information see:TOPDRAWER DATA.
