Selects whether hist is rescaled when it overflows.  Normally the
TOPDRAWER automatically picks the scale of the displayed histogram.  Then
when it is too big to fit on the screen, it is erased and rescaled.  If
you set limits before the MONITOR command, they are used to determine the
scale of the histogram.  The histogram is not automatically rescaled, if
the limits are picked or if RESCALE=OFF.
(Default:ON)
