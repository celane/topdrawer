<B><H4>15.64.59.3  DIRECTION</H4></B>  - 
     DIRECTION=xv,yv,zv
Direction vector from CENTER to eye.
     THETA=angle  PHI=angle  br;Alternate  specification  of  DIRECTION in
polar coordinates.  This is probably an easier  number  to  specify.   You
should specify either the DIRECTION or THETA and PHI.  These are specified
<A NAME="180">relative to the VERTICAL vector. </A>

PHI is the angle in degrees from vertical to line through the eye.  PHI is
the azimuthal angle of the viewers eye.
(Default:60.0)


                                  <U>WARNING</U>

     The  alogorithm  used  in  Histogramming  or  Joining  the  data
     requires that the viewpoint can  not  be  "over"  the  structure
     being  plotted.  The hidden line removal algorithm will not work
     for an improperly placed viewpoint.  You should avoid  PHI=0  or
     PHI=180.



THETA  is  the  angle  between  projections in the horizontal plane of the
X-Axis and the line to the viewing position.  THETA is the polar angle  of
the viewers eye.
(Default:30.0)

                                  Example
You wish to look at the plot from the +X axis:
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>THREE</U> <U>THETA=0</U>
You wish to lood at the plot from the +Y axis:
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>THREE</U> <U>THETA=90</U>
