<B><H4>15.1  FORMAT_OF_COMMANDS</H4></B> 

Normally 1 command is placed on a single line.  If you wish  to  put  more
than 1 command per line, they must be separated by a semicolon ";"

You may continue a command on the next line by putting a minus sign "-" at
the end of the current line.
     TD:<U>SHOW</U> <U>DATA</U> <U>-</U>
     _TD:<U>STAT=OFF</U> <U>(continuation</U> <U>example)</U>

Optional  syntax  in  a command is shown enclosed in square brackets "[]".
Required syntax may be enclosed in braces {}.   If  options  are  mutually
exclusive they are separated by vertical bars "|" Options within a command
may appear in any order.  Parameters must follow the option  they  modify.
Options  in  a  command  may  be  separated  by tabs spaces * , or =.  For
example SIZE=5 is the same as SIZE 5 or SIZE=5 or ,SIZE 5.

Commands and options may be abbreviated to the shortest number  of  unique
characters or a minimum of 2 characters.  For example the command BARGRAPH
may be abbreviated to BARGR, BAR or  even  BA.   SET  FILE  INPUT  may  be
abbreviated to SE FI IN.  All commands may be abbreviated to 3 characters.
The minimum abbreviation for each option is underlined.

Commands  are  read  from left to right.  If conflicting options are given
for the same command, the right most option is used.  For example SET AXES
ON OFF turns the axes off.

Many  commands  have synonyms.  For example AXES or AXIS, STOP or END, NEW
FRAME or NEW PLOT or just NEW.

Comments  may be added to a command by enclosing them in parentheses "()".
If the line begins with a double slash, "//" the rest of  the  line  is  a
comment.
