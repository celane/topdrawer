This sets the default texture of a line drawn by a BOX,  CIRCLE,  ELLIPSE,
DIAMOND,  PLOT,  BAR,  JOIN,  or  HIST command.  To set the Texture of the
axes, ticks, or outline See:Command SET AXIS, SET OUTLINE, or  SET  TICKS.
You may also specify the texture with any command that draws.  For example
you may JOIN DOTS or JOIN PATTERN and so on.

     1.  SOLID - Solid line
     2.  DOTS - Dotted line
     3.  DASHES - Short dashed line
     4.  DAASHES - Long dashed line (3x)
     5.  DOTDASH - Dot-dash line
     6.  SPACE - Adds an extra space between dots/dashes
     7.  PATTERNED - Line determined by SET PATTERN.
     8.  FUNNY  -  is  a  dot  at  the ends of each line segment.  This is
         generally only useful for joined and smoothed curves.
     9.  PERMANENT - Sets the current texture to be the permanent default.

(Default:SOLID)

If  no  options  are  specified  it  is  set to SOLID.  When a new plot is
started the texture is set to the permanent default.

If you specify more than 1 texture option, or use the option PATTERN, then
a patterned texture is assumed and the pattern is generated.   When  FUNNY
precedes any other texture specifier then it is generated randomly.
