TOP,BOTTOM,RIGHT,LEFT  -  Specify  the title position relative to the data
window.  GENERAL is a synonym for TOP.   The  title  is  centered  at  the
appropriate  position.   The size and angle are determined by the SET SIZE
command.  If a size, or x,y,z are specified,  they  override  the  default
position and size.  A TOP title is generally drawn with character size 1.5
times the default.  If no other options are specified, then the  character
size  is reduced by up to a factor of 4 to keep the title from overflowing
the screen.
