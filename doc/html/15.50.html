     <U>NE</U>W [<U>FR</U>AME|<U>PL</U>OT] [<U>RE</U>SET] [ALIAS=alias] "Comment about plot"
Starts  a new picture.  Untreated points are PLOTTED before going on.  The
old data points are retained until new  ones  are  read.   Parameters  are
returned to the default values.  If the plot device is interactive and you
are executing commands inside a file the program prompts:
     PAUSE:
You press the "Return" key to start the next plot.  If instead of "return"
you type in STOP, TOPDRAWER will stop executing the input file and  return
to  command  level.   You  can  also type EXIT, QUIT, HALT, END, or Ctrl_Z
instead of STOP.

If  you  press  Ctrl_C  then  TOPDRAWER will skip input until another STOP
command is encountered, or the file ends.  Pressing Ctrl_C  twice  rapidly
in succession will abort all file input.  Pressing Ctrl_C twice rapidly in
succession again will cause the program to ask you if you wish to abort.
