The fonts are selected in 2 different ways for plot symbols and titles.

For  plot  symbols  you  use a 2 character identifier for the symbol.  For
example 0O selects the cross as a plot symbol.  See commands:
     1.  SET SYMBOL
     2.  PLOT
     3.  SET ORDER

For  titles  the  special symbols are selected with the CASE command.  The
case command specifies a string with a font selection character  for  each
character  in  the  title.   For  example  you  wish  to  write  in  Greek
Alpha,Beta,Gamma followed by ABC.
     TD:<U>TITLE</U> <U>"ABGABC"</U>
     TD:<U>CASE</U>  <U>"GGG</U>   <U>"</U>
