<B><H4>15.64.6.3  BREAK</H4></B>   - BREAK=n  in  inches  sets  the size of a break in the
error bars at the symbol.  When set to a non  zero  value  the  error  bar
"breaks" at the symbol.  Essentially it is not drawn for a distance n from
the center of the symbol.  By setting this the  error  bar  is  not  drawn
through the symbol.  It is drawn only on either side of the symbol.

If  n is negative n is the fraction of the symbol size for the data point.
If n is not specified it is assumed to be -1.  This is ignored if there is
no symbol or SYMBOL=NONE.
(Default:0)
