<B><H4>15.65.6.3  ALL|FULL</H4></B>  - Shows all data about the histograms.  This includes
the ID,NAME, SIZE, and  range  of  values.   For  some  packages  entries,
over/underflows,  sum, mean, and standard deviations are also listed.  For
Rice histograms the cuts are also listed.  This option may slow  the  time
to  show  each  histogram, especially MESH histograms.  This will not show
extra information about histograms in an HBOOK4 RZ file.   ALL=ON  is  the
opposite of BRIEF=OFF.
