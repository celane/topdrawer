This defines a key on the keypad.
     CALL DEFKEY(string)

The  keypad  key  is  defined  in  a  manner similar to the DEFINE/KEY VMS
command.  All of the ASK routines and READPR  will  interpret  the  keypad
keys,  according  to  the  DEFKEY routine.  DEFKEY and READPR are routines
which work together.

                                  Example
     CALL DEFKEY('/KEY PF2 "HELP"/TERMINATE')
This is the default definition of PF2
