     $ LINK Routine, -
          TOPDRAWER_OLB[/INCLUDE=TD]/LIBRARY, -
          PACKLIB_OLB/LIBRARY,MATHLIB_OLB/LIBRARY,
          UGS_OLB/LIBRARY

If you wish to link a standalone version of topdrawer use /INCLUDE=TD.

For  example  you  wish  to make up a version of Topdrawer to do fits with
your own supplied function TDUFUN.   You  would  link  a  new  version  as
follows:
     $ LINK TDUFUN, -
          TOPDRAWER_OLB/INCLUDE=TD/LIBRARY, -
          PACKLIB_OLB/LIBRARY,MATHLIB_OLB/LIBRARY,
          UGS_OLB/LIBRARY
