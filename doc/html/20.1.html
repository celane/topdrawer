<B><H4>20.1  OBSOLETE_COMMANDS</H4></B> 

Most  commands  in  the  "original" version still work.  There are the few
known exceptions.
     1.  DUMP - Removed
     2.  SET FILE DEBUG - Removed
     3.  SET FILE ERROR - Removed
     4.  SET  FILE  INPUT n - No longer works the same.  Instead of a unit
         number you must specify a file name.
     5.  SET  FILE OUTPUT n - No longer works the same.  Instead of a unit
         number you must specify a file name.
     6.  TIME - Replaced by SHOW TIME.
     7.  SET DEVICE 4013 - Removed.
     8.  Certain  undocumented commands were removed.  Specifically in the
         original version the option SET may be omitted entirely,  but  it
         must be used in the BONNER LAB version for set commands.
