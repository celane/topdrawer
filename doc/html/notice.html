NOTE:  
This is an automatic translation from "<CODE>TOPDRAWER.DOC</CODE>", 
the original reference manual of the VMS-verion.  
Some features are lost in the port to UNIX made at FNAL, 
although most of them are restored in the 
<A HREF="http://iris.riken.go.jp/iris/topdrawer/topdrawer.txt">
present port</A>.  
The enhanced features, such as the extended fonts and the symbols, 
are described in "README.Linux".  
Some of them will be demonstrated by "<CODE>whatsnew.top</CODE>" 
in the directory "<CODE>examples</CODE>"

                     TOPDRAWER
         Version 5.12 ( Rice Bonner Lab )
                     July 1993

            Fermilab Document PP0005.1

    TOPDRAWER is a keyword-driven interface to the SLAC
    Unified Graphics system, designed  specifically  to
    generate  physics  graphs  with  minimal specifica-
    tions.  Reasonable defaults are  assumed  for  axis
    scales,  tic  locations,  label locations and size,
    etc.

    Topdrawer  originated  at  the  Stanford Linear Ac-
    celerator Center.  The  manual  for  this  modified
    version            is           online           in
    TOPDRAWERROOT:[DOC]TOPDRAWER.DOC,  and  via   HELP,
    both at the VMS level and within the Topdrawer pro-
    gram.  The original SLAC document  number  is  CTGM
    178.

    Many  devices are supported, including Xwindows and
    Tektronix displays,  and  Postscript,  QMS1200  and
    EXCL printers.
