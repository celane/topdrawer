     SAMPLES=s      applies      binomial      statistics      to      Dn,
Dn=SQRT(max(n,1)*max(s-n,1)/s).  You must supply  the  number  of  samples
(s).   If  you  generate  a  set of data by a Monte-Carlo method where the
total number of hits s is selected, but the distribution of  the  hits  is
generated by the program then you should use Binomial statistics.
