<B><H4>15.64.36.2  ABORT</H4></B>  - If an error occurs during a command the command is
aborted.  This applies generally to commands that produce output such as
ARROW, BOX, CIRCLE, HISTOGRAM, PLOT, BAR, JOIN, and LIST as well as
SMOOTH, BIN, X=, and so on.  It does not apply to the SET commands.  In
addition ABORT just prevents journaling of inconvenient commands such as
SHOW, SPAWN, and HELP.
