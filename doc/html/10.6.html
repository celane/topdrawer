Time  may  be  entered  in hours in the format hh:mm:ss.nnn.  You may also
enter angles as dd:mm:ss.nn in degrees, minutes, seconds.  Time  or  angle
data  must  begin  with  a  number.  0::1.5 is legal for 1.5 seconds after
midnight, while ::1.5 is not legal.

Dates  may  be  entered  in  hours as YYYY\MM\DD.  If omitted MM or DD are
assumed to be 1.  If you wish to enter both date and time  the  format  is
YYYY\MM\DD\HH:mm:ss.ss.  See:Command SET DATE.

applies  only to the YYYY (Year).  Signs (+ -) may not be imbedding inside
a date\time.
