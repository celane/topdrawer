     1.  LEVEL - Selects the number of subintervals from 2 to 10.
         (Default:LEVEL=2)

<A NAME="89">     2.  SPLINE|GENERAL - Selects the type of fit to use in interpolation. </A>
         (Default:GENERAL)
     3.  CLOSED  forces the interpolation to consider the data as a closed
         curve.  CLOSED=OFF will fil an unclosed curve even when the first
         and last points are identical.
         (Default:data determines closure)
     4.  POINTS - Selects the data points to use by number.
     5.  SETS - Selects the range of data sets to interpolate.
     6.  SELECT="name" - Selects the data sets by name
     7.  LIMITED  -  Selects  the points to use by a range of values.  The
         actual data  selected  will  include  all  data  that  meets  the
         selection.   Some  data  outside  of the range may be included to
         avoid breaking up a data set into multiple pieces.
     8.  APPEND  -  Appends  the  new  data  sets.  Otherwise the new data
         replaces the old set.
         (Default:APPEND=OFF)
