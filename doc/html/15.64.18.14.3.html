<B><H4>15.64.18.14.3  Windows</H4></B>   - Normally  when you do plots in REGIS the cursor
is left at the top of the screen.  If your terminal  is  capable  of  more
than  24  lines,  you  may  wish  to freeze the top 24 lines, and create a
scrolling region underneath the plot.  Assume your terminal has more  than
24  lines  and  less  than  100.   This  is  possible if it is an emulated
terminal using a windowing system.  To move the cursor to  the  bottom  of
the screen:
     TD:SET PROMPT BOTTOM,'TD:'
To freeze or thaw the top few lines:
     TD:define command freeze 'type 27,"7",27,"[24;r",27,"8",27,"M"'
     TD:define command thaw 'type 27,"7",27,"[0;r",27,"8",27,"M"'
You issue the command FREEZE to freeze the top lines, and THAW to unfreeze
them.  You will want to FREEZE when you are doing plots, and the thaw when
you are showing data, or parameters, so you can use the whole window.

For your convenience you may do all of this by:
     TD:SET FILE INPUT TOPDRAWER_ROOT:[EXAMPLES]FREEZE

Now  when you do plot the top part of your screen is used to view the plot
while the bottom is used to give the commands.

<A NAME="135">If  your screen has only 24 lines you may wish to reduce the plot size and </A>
freeze the top 22 lines.  This will give you a 2 line command window.   To
do this:
     SET FILE INPUT TOPDRAWER_ROOT:[EXAMPLES]FREEZE22
Similarly there is a FREEZE30 and FREEZE40 file.
