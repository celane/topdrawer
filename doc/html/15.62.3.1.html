     1.  AREA  selects  the directory of the disk file/global section.  If
         this is unspecified then  the  subdirectory  on  the  file/global
         section  is  assumed  to be the same as specified by the previous
         SET HIST AREA command.
     2.  FETCH is for histograms stored in machine dependent HBOOK3 format
         by HSTORE.  Either all  histograms  or  1  histogram  ID  may  be
         fetched.
     3.  FILE=file_name  selects  the file name or global section name for
         the shared histograms.  If FILE is not specified then it defaults
         to  HBOOK.BIN.   If  the  filename  is  NONE then no file name is
         selected.
     4.  IDENT Selects the ID of the histogram to get.  If unspecified all
         histograms are fetched.
     5.  INPUT gets histograms from a direct access file in HBOOK4 format.
         This is the default.
         <U>NOTE</U> Topdrawer checks the file and will try to figure out whether
<A NAME="118">         to FETCH, READ, or INPUT the file. </A>
     6.  READ is for the machine independent HBOOK3 format.
     7.  RELATIVE  saves  histograms in a relative file for faster access.
         Otherwise a sequential file is used.
         (Default:RELATIVE=OFF)
     8.  SECTION  gets  histograms  from the specified global section.  If
         SECTION="" the current section is used.  SEE:TOPDRAWER LINK
     9.  SHARE shares the file with other users.  SHARE=OFF prohibits file
         sharing.
         (Default:SHARE=ON)
    10.  VERSION  Selects  the  cycle (version number) of the histogram to
         get.  (INPUT only)
    11.  IOFSET is added to the hist ID when fetched.  (INPUT only)
    12.  APPEND Sets IOFSET=largest hist ID.
    13.  ADD adds the new histograms to the current ones.  Normally all in
         the current directory are deleted.  ADD works only with INPUT, or
         with Global sections.

         NOTE:  If you have a large number of histograms resident, you may
         not have enough memory to RESTORE ADD all at once.  You may force
         TOPDRAWER to add one at a time by:
              RESTORE HISTOGRAM ADD ID FROM 1 TO 99999
    14.  SUBTRACT,MULTIPLY,DIVIDE  works  in  a  similar  fashion  to ADD.
         SUBTRACT subtracts the new histogram from the old  one...   These
         do not work for HBOOK3 histograms.
    15.  TREE restores the entire directory tree.  (INPUT/SECTION only) If
         this is selected along with AREA it is possible to graft  a  file
         resident directory tree to a new root.
