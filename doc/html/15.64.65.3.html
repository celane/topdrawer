<B><H4>15.64.65.3  RELATIVE</H4></B>   - If n2 is omitted then the last n2 for the current
plot is assumed.  Both n1 and n2 must be larger than 0.8 and n1 may not be
larger  than 1.2*n2.  If both n1 and n2 are positive the window is reduced
in size to allow for labels and titles.  If negative the  window  occupies
the  entire  space.   If  you  do not specify a fixed symbol, grid, label,
title, or tick size then they are adjusted to  be  in  proportion  to  the
window  size.  Absolute windows do not adjust the sizes.  If n2 is omitted
then the current n2 is assumed.

For  windows  which do not occupy the entire space, the actual size of the
window depends on the location and position of  labels  and  titles.   The
size  is  set  to  allow a 5% border with room for titles and labels.  The
default is a window with approximately 8.5% left on the right and top  for
titles,  and  13%  on  the bottom and left for labels and titles.  For 3-d
plots it is assumed that no labels will be produced.  To change  the  size
available for titles and labels use the SET TITLE and SET LABELS commands.

Non  integral  n1  or  n2  may  be  used  for fine adjustment.  If you use
negative  windows  you  may  also  need  to  turn   off   INSIDE   labels.
