<B><H4>15.64.34.3  CHARACTERS</H4></B>   - CHARACTERS=n  specifies  the  maximum number of
characters in left or right titles.  When setting up the windows  room  is
allocated  for  the  specified  number  of  characters.   The room is only
allocated if the corresponding axis and labels are enabled.   If  negative
the  actual number of characters needed is used to locate titles.  LEFT or
RIGHT titles are only  moved  over  according  to  the  number  of  actual
characters if they are plotted after the corresponding axes.

                                  Example
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>LABELS</U> <U>CHARACTERS=4</U> <U>PERMANENT</U>
All plots will allocate room for 4 character labels on the left and right.
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>LABELS</U> <U>CHARACTERS=-6</U>
     TD:<U>PLOT</U> <U>AXES</U>
     TD:<U>TITLE</U> <U>LEFT</U> <U>'Flush</U> <U>title</U>
First  the  window  is  allocated  leaving room for 6 characters, then the
title is located according to the actual number of characters used to form
the labels.
