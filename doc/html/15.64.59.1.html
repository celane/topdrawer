     2.  DIRECTION=xv,yv,zv  -  Controls  the  direction you are "looking"
         from.
     3.  THETA=angle - The direction you are looking from (polar angle)
     4.  PHI=angle - The direction you are looking from (Azimuthal angle)
     5.  DISTANCE - Distance from you to the object.
     6.  SCRD - Distance from you to the viewing window.
     7.  RDISTANCE  - Modifies DISTANCE + SCRD together (DISTANCE from you
         to object)
     8.  REDUCE|MAGNIFY  - Modifies size of the object relative to current
