This reads from the SYS$INPUT after prompting
     CALL READPR('PROMPT',STRING,LENGTH,[Itimeout])

INPUT:
     PROMPT= string to prompt with
     Itimeout= timeout time in seconds (integer) If the time between typed
characters exceeds the timeout then the read is terminated.
OUTPUT:
     STRING = input
     LENGTH = length of the input

You  may  define  keypad keys to return a string using DEFKEY.  DEFKEY and
READPR are routines which work together.

This subroutine is independent from the rest of TOPDRAWER

                                  example
     CHARACTER*20 STR
     CALL READPR('Input:',STR,I,60)
     IF (I.gt.0) TYPE *,'STR=",STR(1:I),'"'
Reads  a  string  of 20 characters or less and writes it on your terminal.
You have 60 seconds to begin typing after the prompt.
