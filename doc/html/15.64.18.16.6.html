<B><H4>15.64.18.16.6  Windows</H4></B>    - Sone   TEK4010   emulators   are   capable  of
simultaneous graphics and text where  the  graphics  scrolls  off  of  the
screen.   An  example of such a terminal is the Visual-630.  For this type
of terminal you may wish to reduce the plot size and  freeze  the  top  22
lines.   This  will give you a 2 line command window with a fixed graphics
window.  To do this:
     TD:SET FILE INPUT TOPDRAWER_ROOT:[EXAMPLES]FREEZE22
When you wish to use the whole window for listings you type:
     TD:THAW
and then to restore the 2 line command window:
     TD:FREEZE
