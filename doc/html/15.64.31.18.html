<B><H4>15.64.31.18  TITLE</H4></B>   - This plots the histogram name as a title.  The name
may be split into 4 parts, Top, X,  Y,  and  Z  by  separating  them  with
semicolons.
     Top label;X label;Y label;Z label
If  the  number  of lines is insufficient for a title, then it is omitted.
For example you wish to omit the Y title so you:
     TD:SET TITLE LEFT LINES=0

WARNING For 3-D histograms the title should not be plotted until after the
histogram has been plotted.  If you omit ON or OFF then ON is assumed.
(Default:TITLE=OFF)
