<B><H4>15.60.2.3  Bin_spacing</H4></B>   - The  points/bins must be strictly monotonically
spaced along the axes for good results.

If  a  histogram  has  unequal  size  bins,  the  last  bin edge should be
specified with the option END.  If this is not done, the bins may  not  be
properly  represented.   If bin edges are not specified, The bin edges are
half way between the points.  Mesh  points  are  assumed  to  be  centered
within each bin.
