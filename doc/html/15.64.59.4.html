<B><H4>15.64.59.4  DISTANCE,SCRD,RDIST</H4></B>  - 
     DISTANCE=nnn
Distance from CENTER to the EYE (Default:35in.)
     SCRD=nnn
Distance from screen or viewing window to EYE.  (Default:-18in.)
     RDISTANCE=nnn
Same  as distance, but the SCRD is changed also to keep the view the same.
(Relative distance)

If  SCRD  is negative then the actual SCRD is adjusted so that the view is
the same independent of the current window size.  If |SCRD| = 0.5*DISTANCE
then the plot will fill the current window.

Essentially  the SCRD is the distance from you to the screen, and DISTANCE
is the distance to the object being viewed.  The  ratio  of  SCRD/DISTANCE
determines  the  plot  size  while  the  absolute  distance determines the
perspective of the plot.  Large distances produce essentially  a  parallel
projection.  If you wish to modify the plot size use the MAGNIFY or REDUCE
option.

Sometimes vertical lines are treated as being hidden when in fact they are
visible.  This may be corrected by moving the  view  point  far  from  the
screen.  To set a distant viewpoint:
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>THREE</U> <U>RDIST=8000</U>
RDIST  adjusts  the  viewpoint  without changing the size of the resulting
<A NAME="181">plot. </A>
