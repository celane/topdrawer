<B><H4>15.68  SPAWN</H4></B> 

This command temporarily spawns  out  of  TOPDRAWER  to  VMS.   The  SPAWN
command is not journaled unless ABORT=OFF MODE is selected.
     <U>SP</U>AWN [dcl_command]

For  example  you  are  trying  to  do  a plot, but you have forgotten the
filename with the TOPDRAWER source, so you:
     TD:<U>SPAWN</U>  <U>DIRECTORY</U>  You will get a directory listing so you can find
<A NAME="203">the file name. </A>

If  you  use the SPAWN command with no parameters, you return to TOPDRAWER
with the VMS command:
     $ <U>LOGOFF</U>
