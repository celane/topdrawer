         the function
     4.  SCALE - Does fit to LOG(X) or LOG(Y) if the scale is set to LOG.
     5.  ORDER|TERMS=n - The max number of terms used in the fit.
     6.  OFFSET=n - An offset for the X value to set the center of the fit
     7.  COEFFICIENTS - Selects constant coefficients.
     8.  ECOEFFICIENTS|ERRORS - Selects constant coefficient errors.
         A.  CONSTRAIN selects whether coefficient is constrained.
         B.  INDEX selects the coefficient number.
     9.  INCLUDE|EXCLUDE - Selects coef.  to fit or exclude from the fit.
                                 Curve generation
    10.  CURVE - Produces a data set containing the fitted curve.
         A.  APPEND appends the new curve to the data sets.
         B.  NAME selects the new data set name.
         C.  [X|Y] from n1 to n2 by n3 selects the range and bin width for
             the curve.

    16.  MINUIT - Does nonlinear fits using interactive MINUIT.
    17.  NONLINEAR   -   Selects   nonlinear   or   linear  fitting.   For
         NONLINEAR=on Uses linear fitting techniques if on.  If  off  uses
         MINUIT.
         A.  REPEAT selects the maximum number of tries.
         B.  PRINTELEVEL select the amount of log output.
         C.  GRADIENT  selects  whether the calculated derivitives are use
             in the fitting.
         D.  TOLERENCE selects the tolerence for good fit
         E.  ECHISQ selects the error in chisq for finding errors in coef.
             (Default:1.0)
    18.  Output options
    19.  LOG  - Enables/Disable the terminal listing of the results of the
         fit.
    20.  FULL - Enables output of error matrix as part of LOG.
    21.  MONITOR - Plots the original data and the fit.
