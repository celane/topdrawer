<B><H4>15.58.2.3  GRID</H4></B>   - If  specified  without  the option AXES then a GRID is
plotted.  The grid must be ON to be plotted.  See SET GRID.   If  AXES  is
specified, then both are plotted if the GRID is ON.  Grid lines or symbols
are plotted only for long ticks.

                                  example
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>GRID</U> <U>ON</U>

The  grid is plotted at ticks 2,4,6,8 on the X and 0 on the Y.  An axes is
also plotted with labels at X=2,4,6,8 Y=0, and short ticks at X=1,3,5,7,9.
