     1.  BY selects the data set to convolute by.  You may specify either
         the name or the data set number.
     2.  CHECK=OFF Turns off the error checking.  Normally the 2 data sets
         must have matching channel widths.  And each data set must have
         equally spaced x values and y values if a mesh.
         (Default:ON)
     3.  ERROR=OFF Errors are not calculated for the result.
         (Default:ON)
     4.  INVERT=ON Convolutes by the inverted function.  This is not an
         exact calculation.  The resulting data may exhibit ripples, due
         to the inversion process.  Inversion uses CERN library routine
         CFT.
         (Default:OFF)
     5.  NORMALIZE=ON Convolutes the data set with a normalized nset.
         (Default:OFF)
     6.  APPEND=ON Creates a new data set containing the entire result.
         The appended set is longer than the original set to contain the
         entire result.  If you do not select APPEND some data might be
         lost.
         (Default:OFF)
     7.  MONITOR Histograms both the original data and the result in 2
         windows.
         See:SET MONITOR
     8.  NAME selects the name for the new appended data set.
     9.  SELECT selects data sets to convolute by name.
    10.  LOG=ON Logs the operation on your terminal.
         (Default:OFF)
