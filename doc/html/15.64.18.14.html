monitor,  or  suitable  emulator  such  as  the  VT-300  emulation  on   a
VAXstation.   (note:VT-241 can only reproduce the colors RED,GREEN,BLUE or
WHITE,RED,GREEN).  The TEKTRONIX driver is slightly  faster  on  a  VT-240
than  the  REGIS  driver.  The physical screen size is set to 10.56 by 6.6
inches or 26.85 by 16.76 cm.  These devices support Hardware structure and
hardware characters in any size.  The GIGI also supports BLINK mode.
