V_XVALUE[n,ns]  is  the n'th value in set ns.  Likewise V_DXVALUE[n,ns] is
the  n'th  value  in  set  ns.   You  may  also  access  Y,DY,Z,  and  DZ.
S_SYMBOL[n,ns]  is  the symbol for the the n'th value in set ns.  If ns is
omited then n is the point number.

For  MESH  plots  V_XVALUE[n1],V_YVALUE[n2],V_ZVALUE[n1,n2]  are  used  to
access the data point values where n1 is the column number and n2  is  the
row number.

If both n and ns are omitted then it is the value for the current point in
an X=,DX=,Y=...  command.
