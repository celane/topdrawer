This  determines  the  texture of the line.  By stringing together several
texture commands you may create very complicated  textures.   For  example
DOT  SPACE DOT DASH will produce a dot-dot-dast pattern with a large space
between the dots.

     1.  SOLID produces a totally solid line.  This overrides all previous
         specifications.
     2.  DOT produces a dot
     3.  DASH produces a short dash
     4.  DAASH produces a long dash
     5.  SPACE produces extra space between previous elements
     6.  FUNNY produces random distances between elements
     7.  PATTERNED  makes the pattern according to the current SET pattern
         if it is specified by itself.  If specified with other options it
         produces the patterns by generating a pattern.  The length of the
         elements is determined by the size in the SET PATTERN command.
     8.  Some  combinations  will  produce  the  patterns by hardware when
         available.  This makes for quick, but not necessarily nice plots.
         The following generally use hardware:
         A.  DOT
         B.  DASH
         C.  DOT DASH
         D.  DAASH
