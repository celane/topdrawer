<B><H4>15.64.18.18  VERSATEC</H4></B>   - Versatec  1200  printer/plotter.   The  plotting
space is 10.55" by 7.8" (26.8cm by 19.81cm) 2110 by 1560 pixels.  Plotting
nominally  begins 0.35" from the perforations.  The 7.8" is nominal due to
variations in the paper feed.  There is always a margin of 0.225"  on  the
short  side  of  the paper.  The following options may be specified inside
the string.
     1.  "LENGTH=n,inches" - n is the length of the paper in inches.  This
         allows you to make long plots on roll paper, or plots that  bleed
         across  the  page  boundaries.   You can also make a plot smaller
         using this parameter.
