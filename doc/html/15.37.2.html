Redo  the  last  fit.   This  option must be the first option on the line.
After the fit command.  When you redo the fit you may specify new  options
to  modify the fit.  If you want to set fit options without doing any fits
use the command
     SET FIT [options]
This  sets  fitting  options to be performed by the next fit command.  The
options on SET FIT are identical to the options on FIT.   You  may  use  a
series of SET FIT commands to setup the next fit.
