be  separated  by  spaces,  tabs,  or  commas",".  Numbers may also be run
together without separators, provided they begin with either plus  "+"  or
minus "-".  If you wish to enter several data points on a single line then
they may be separated by semicolons ";".  Instead of a number you may also
use expressions by enclosing it inside angle brakets "&lt;&gt;".
