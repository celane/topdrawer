     1.  Jan-1990  -  Optimized expression evaluation to achieve a 30 fold
         speedup.  Added  error  handling  to  smoothing  routine.   Added
         support for a postscript printer.
     2.  Feb-1990  -  Added  EQUATION  option  to FIT.  For general linear
         fits.  Optimized the auto label generation for logarithmic  axes.
         Removed  restrictions  on  order  of DECADES, SUBTICKS in the SET
         SCALE command.  Added device UIS to be able  to  dump  screen  of
         Vaxstation  to  disk  in full resolution.  Made VAXstation driver
         work for color station.  Added color mappings for DECGIGI driver.
     3.  July-1990  -  Fixed PROJECT command in TOPDRAWER.  It was correct
         in NTOPDRAWER.  It would sometimes  give  incorrect  results  for
         HBOOK histograms.
         Added  options  FETCH and READ to TOPDRAWER command RESTORE HIST.
         (Version 3.5)

<A NAME="243">         Note:   some  versions  may  have  had  problems with the fitting </A>
         lexicals.  VCOEFFICIENT...  as some modules  were  compiled  with
         /Gfloat  and  some  were  not.   The  standard is /GFLOAT for all
         double precision operations if it is  supported  by  the  machine
         that it is compiled on.

         Fixed  lexicals V...  inside expressions.  Y="VXVALUE**2" yielded
         incorrect results while Y="XVALUE**2" was correct.  This  problem
         dated from Jan-1990 when optimization was introduced.
     4.  Dec-1990     -     Added     options     WEIGHT,    EWEIGHT    to
         ADD,SUBTRACT,MULTIPLY,DIVIDE commands.  These allow weighting  of
         data when doing the operation.
