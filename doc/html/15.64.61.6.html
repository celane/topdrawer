<B><H4>15.64.61.6  MARGIN</H4></B>   - This  sets  a fractional margin around each window.
Normally this is 0.025 or 2.5% of the total window size.  You may  set  it
to any value from 0.0 to 0.4.  If you use relative or numbered windows the
final window size is reduced by the margin as well as the number of  title
lines,  and labels.  The margin is not absulute.  You may still put titles
inside the margin, by specifying the title location.
(Default:0.025)
