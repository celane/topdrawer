<B><H4>15.64.61.11  Windows</H4></B>  - When you specify a relative or numbered window the
window is first reduced by  the  margin  fraction.   Then  each  title  is
allocated INDEX*LINES*SIZE*SCALE around the window.  Finally the window is
reduced to make room for labels.  Each title except for the bottom will be
positioned INDEX*SIZE*SCALE*(LINES-.5) from the edge of the window+labels.
The bottom is positioned INDEX*SIZE*SCALE/2 from the window+labels.
