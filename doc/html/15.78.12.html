Multiplies  the  selected  coordinate  by  the selected value.  If you are
multiplying X,Y, or Z by a constant the DX,DY, or DZ are  also  multiplied
by  the  constant.   In  addition if ERROR was specified then the final Dn
will be modified  by  the  specified  error.   DY=SQRT(DY**2+(e*n/c)**2)*c
where C is the specified constant.

If  a coordinate and a number are specified, but no operator then TIMES is
assumed.
                                  example
To multiply y by 2+-0.1
     Y=Y TIMES 2 ERROR=.1
          or...
     Y=Y * 2 ERROR=.1 To multiply y by 2 with no error on the value 2.
     Y=2 Y
          or...
     Y=2 TIMES Y
          or...
     Y=2 * Y
