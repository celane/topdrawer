<B><H4>15.58.10  RANDOM</H4></B> 

RANDOM=n  -  Sets  the maximum number of points per bin for a scatter plot
(3-d) If RANDOM is not specified The number of points  in  a  bin  is  the
value  in the bin-Zmin+1.  The default RANDOM is limited to the range 1 to
10.  If Zmax is less than 1.0 then the default RANDOM is  set  to  5.   No
points are produced when the data equals ZMIN.  Zmin for a scatter plot is
zero unless set by a SET LIMITS command.

If  the  contents of the bins range from 0 to 100 and RANDOM=10, Then each
dot represents the value 10.  Any bin with values less than or equal to  0
will  have no points plotted.  0.00001 to 10.0 will get 1 dot, 10.00001 to
20 will have 2 dots and so on.

If  the  Z  axis  is  logarithmic  then  the  number  of  points  will  be
proportional to ALOG10(Z)-ALOG10(ZMIN).

NORANDOM  modifies a scatter plot so that only one point is plotted in the
center of each bin.  This option should be used  with  either  the  option
LIMITED or VARIABLE.
