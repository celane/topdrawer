     1.  SET COLOR - Now accepts full range of UGSYS color specs.
     2.  SET  FILE  -  Command  rewritten.  It now accepts a file name and
         multiple nesting of SET FILE INPUT is possible.
     3.  Unit numbers modified to allow batch input.
     4.  SET  DEVICE  DDNAME=filename  -  The  limitation  of  8  chars on
         filename is removed.
     5.  SET DEVICE - INTERACTIVE is the default.
     6.  HELP - New command added.
     7.  Added prompting for interactive input.
     8.  PLOT_TERM,  PLOT_DEVICE  symbols  are  used  to determine default
         device.

<A NAME="238">     9.  TOKEN - Tabs are treated as spaces. </A>
    10.  SIXELS is now a legal device.
    11.  SET INPUT is a synonym of SET CARD.
    12.  SET ERRORS - New command added.
    13.  Fixed SET DEVICE command so SIDEWAYS works properly.
    14.  INTENSITY/WIDTH  3  did  not work properly, and would cause other
         options to work improperly.
    15.  SET DEVICE accepts lowercase chars.  in string.
    16.  SET STRUCTURE can now set FUNNY.
    17.  HISTOGRAM command now produces a BLOCK plot for 3-d data.
    18.  FLUSH command flushes the buffers.
    19.  Fixed UG errors when no plot make.
    20.  Fixed  failure  to  SET  DEVICE  in  the middle of an interactive
         session.
    21.  Added JOURNAL file and SET JOURNAL command.
    22.  Added SHOW commands as mirror to SET commands.
    23.  Rewrote  T23HST  to  add  fast  "LEGO"  plots  as well as minimal
         histograms.
    24.  TITLE X|Y|Z now produces titles next to 3-d axes.  The lables and
         titles are always drawn on the outer side of axes by default.
    25.  T23HST,T23JIN accept a texture parameter.  T23HST may plot hidden
         lines with the option HIDE.
    26.  T2FREQ  modified  for  incomplete  storage.   Now  only  X,Y  are
         required.
    27.  Modified TXDOT and TXTSYM to produce points directly from unified
         graphics.  This makes better points for hi  resolution  displays,
         and faster points on Tek4010 displays.
    28.  T23PLT - added to do scatter plots.
    29.  SLICE - command added to plot slices of mesh data.
    30.  Fixed T2DEF2 so limits are properly defined at all times.
    31.  Added  SET  HIST  command.   This  is  conditionalized  for the 3
         different types of hist routines.  You can get RICE  format,  and
         HBOOK format hist files to be displayed by TOPDRAWER.
    32.  SHOW DATA can show you a subset of the data, with calculations of
         statistics on the data.
    33.  3D is now properly selected for each type of hist.
    34.  DEFINE KEY - Defines keypad keys for ANSII terminals.
    35.  The  previous  20 input lines are stored for recall by ANSII mode
         terms.  This is done using SMG routines so foreign terminals  can
         be defined also.
    36.  Traceback for input files has been added.
    37.  Modified   TXLINE  for  optimized  point  plotting.   Essentially
         drawing points with UGMARK is faster  for  some  protocalls  than
         drawing  zero  length lines.  This is automatically done wherever
         possible.  This is especially true for 4010 graphics.  A  cluster
         of Nearby dots can save a factor of 3 in transfer time.
    38.  Regularized   the   error   messages,   and  added  messages  for
         PEN,WIDTH,CARD LENGTH out of range.
    39.  Added  PERMANENT option to SET SYMBOL,GRID,WIDTH This changed the
         logic of SET SYMBOL slightly to conform to other commands.
    40.  The  card  length was changed to conform to standard screen sizes
         (80 cols).  The Format  string  is  (256A1)  to  make  card  size
         changes easy.
    41.  Fixed automatic flush so it works properly for interactive use.
    42.  Fixed  NOVECTOR  mode so that it works.  Make the default VECTOR.
         Removed  '$'  as  a  separator.   This  is  necessary  for   some
         filenames!  (TXXUG77)

<A NAME="239">    43.  29-Oct-1986     -     Added     DSIZE,DOTS,...      options    to </A>
         CIRCL,ELLIPSE,DIAMOND,BOX commands.  (T2MAIN,T2PLOT)
    44.  31-Oct-1986         -         Added         cursor        support
         (T2XFRM,TXXUG77,T2SET1,T2SHOW).
    45.  5-Nov-1986  - Fixed the option PLOT SYMBOL so it works, and fixed
         problem with multiple options after PLOT.
    46.  Added color,texture,intensity control to SET AXES, OUTLINE, GRID,
         TITLE.  Also color, texture may now be specifed for  any  command
         that draws something.  PLOT, HIST, BOX, TITLE....
    47.  Added  support  for  multiple  data sets.  option SETS picks data
         sets.
    48.  Added MESH data support to SMOOTH command.
    49.  14-NOV-1986  -  Fixed  bug  in  T2RDPT.   Data after a symbol was
         skipped.
    50.  Modified string handling to Fortran-77.
    51.  26-Nov-1986 - Added IF,ELSE,ENDIF.
    52.  1-Dec-1986  -  Added  options  SCALE, TICKS, and PERMANENT to SET
         SCALE command.  Added option PERMANENT to  SET  COLOR  and  reset
         color with each new plot.  Fixed a problem with JOIN SPLINE DASH.
         If the points were closely spaced a solid line is  drawn.   Added
         options BLINK, PROPORTIONAL, HARDTEXTURE.
    53.  8-Dec-1986  -  Added  sideways option to SET SIZE.  Added options
         WHITE,...   WIDTH=,  DOTTED  to  SET  TICKS,LABELS,TITLE.    SHOW
         command now shows the Default values as well as the current ones.
    54.  16-Dec-1986  -  Added  options DOT/DASH/DAASH/RANDOM/SPACE to set
         pattern.  Fixed infinite loop when no pattern specified.
    55.  23-Dec-1986  -  Added option for automatic pattern generation for
         drawing commands.  ie.  JOIN DOT DOT DASH generates  the  pattern
         to  do  this.   Added  EXPAND  option  to  JOIN,HIST,PLOT.  Added
         VARIABLE, SIZE, NORANDOM options to PLOT.
