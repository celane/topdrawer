<A NAME="217"> </A>
You have access to data via lexicals.  For example you may access the sum,
mean,  standard  deviation  of  your  data  set and put them into a title.
See:Command TITLE.  Quantities such as points, sum etc.  are calculated by
a  SET  STATISTICS or SHOW DATA command.  If you do not use SET STATISTICS
or SHOW DATA to generate them, they are automatically calculated from  the
entire  data  set.   Whenever  you  modify  the data set, you must use SET
STATISTICS to set the statistics if you wish  the  lexicals  to  represent
only  a  subset of the data.  To use a lexical value you must use a symbol
of the form:  T_NAME, S_NAME, or V_NAME.  The T_NAME inserts the value  of
the  name  into a title string.  V_NAME or &lt;NAME&gt; is used to get the value
as a number.  S_NAME gets a value as a string.   You  may  define  lexical
values by the command DEFINE VALUE or DEFINE STRING.

The  lexicals  may  be  abbreviated  to  the  shortest  unique  name.  For
convenience V_ may be omitted inside an expression.   This  will  increase
the  time  to  parse an expression.  For example &lt;V_XVALUE&gt; is the same as
&lt;XVALUE&gt; or V_XV.
