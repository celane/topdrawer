<B><H4>15.40.15.1  Operation</H4></B>   - If THREE is ON then the histogram is sliced into
a section between v1 and v2.  The data outside of  the  range  is  omitted
from the plot.

If  THREE  is OFF then each line/column of the histogram between v1 and v2
is plotted as a separate histogram.  If both v2 and v1 are  omitted,  then
all slices are plotted.

If  you  wish to add together a series of slices and plot them as a single
histogram see:Command PROJECT.
