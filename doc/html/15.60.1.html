This reads in data to be plotted.  Once data is read, it is retained until
it  has  been used to generate a plot.  It is then discarded when new data
is read.  Normally you plot the data immediately after reading  it.   When
<A NAME="113">you  start  a  new  plot,  the  data  last  plotted is still available for </A>
replotting.  It is not discarded until  new  data  is  read.   The  option
APPEND  allows  you  to append more data to the already plotted data.  The
option SET starts a new data set.  If you do not  specify  a  symbol  when
reading points, the default is determined by the last SET SYMBOL command.

This  command  is not necessary, since TOPDRAWER assumes that a number not
preceded by a command is automatically a point.  If you wish to read  data
with the symbol as the first item, you must use the READ DATA command, and
terminate the data with a blank line.

Values that are omitted are initially set to 0.0, or to the previous value
for that field.

When reading in data &lt;XVALUE&gt;, &lt;DXVALUE&gt;, &lt;YVALUE&gt;, ...  are the X, DX, Y,
...  values from the previous point.
