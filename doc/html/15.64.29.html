Sets the format used by the Fortran READ statement.
<U>SE</U>T <U>FOR</U>MAT "format"

This  is  useful if you wish to skip lines at the beginning of a line when
you are using a list file as input to TOPDRAWER.  Normally you do not need
to use this command, unless the data is in an extremely weird format.  The
format is limited  to  64  characters.   (Default:(256A1)  The  number  of
columns  is  also limited by SET CARD.  This option remains the same until
changed by a SET FORMAT command.  This option has no effect on  input  you
enter interactively at the terminal.
                                  Example
If you wish to skip the first 10 columns:
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>FORMAT</U> <U>"(10x,256A1)"</U>
