<B><H4>15.5  TITLE</H4></B> 

This  takes the name of the data set you are plotting and uses it to write
a title on the plot.  The name  is  divided  into  4  parts  separated  by
semicolons  ";".  The 4 parts are placed at the TOP,X,Y,Z locations of the
plot.  If the default title color,  width  are  none  then  the  title  is
plotted with the same color, width as the the data set.

This  can be very helpful when overlaying several data sets, as the titles
correspond to the data set.
