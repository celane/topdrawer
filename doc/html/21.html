To    install    topdrawer   on   your   system,   copy   the   files   in
TOPDRAWERROOT:[*...] to a directory of your choice.  Execute the SETUP.COM
procedure  to create the necessary local TOPDRAWER symbols and logics.  On
the FNAL cluster, the files are placed in LIB:[LIB.TOPDRAWER.version], and
SETUP   TOPDRAWER   causes   the  SETUP.COM  procedure  to  be  run.   The
TOPDRAWER.HLP help library module has been placed  in  the  LIB  alternate
help library.

You  may wish to rename and delete some of the executables, if your system
lacks Xwindows or GKS.
     1.  TOPDRAWERMIN has neither Xwindows nor GKS support.
     2.  TOPDRAWER has Xwindows but not GKS.
     3.  TOPDRAWERGKS has both.
