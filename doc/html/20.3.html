     1.  1-Feb-1987  - Typing Ctrl_C will abort the current plot or print.
         The SET HISTOGRAM command may select histograms by  substring  in
         the  title.   NEXT|PREVIOUS  may be combined with NAME= to select
         the next hist which matches the name.   NEXT|PREVIOUS  will  wrap
         around the end of the histogram list unless WRAP OFF is specified
         or in BATCH mode.
     2.  12-Feb-1987  -  The journal file will contain coordinates entered
         by  cursor.   The  AUTOPLOT  mode  was  added.    The   condition
         INTERACTIVE  may  be  tested  by  the IF command.  MARGINS may be
         specified in addition to the SCREEN size in the SET SIZE command.
     3.  26-Feb-1987  -  Added  DEFINE  COMMAND and SHOW HIST may now show
         more information.  The option CURRENT  has  been  added  to  SHOW
         HIST.
     4.  10-Mar-1987  -  Added  option  APPEND to SET HIST.  Added options
         POINTS, and SETS to BIN.  Histogramming speed was  optimized  for
         cases  with  a  series  of  identical  Y values.  SHOW DATA gives
         errors on statistics, and statistics are generated for each  data
         set  separately.   Fixed problem with histogramming data withou Z
         values as 3-d plot.
     5.  7-Apr-1987  -  Added  commands  DELETE, FIT.  Fixed some problems
         with separate data sets.
     6.  30-Apr-1987  -  Added option ADD to SET HIST.  If a mesh was read
         with one axes increasing and the other decreasing, it  would  not
         plot properly.  This has been fixed.
<A NAME="240">     7.  8-May-1987  -  Added  contour  plotting, and LOG_ERROR routine to </A>
         trap arithmetic errors.  The error handling returns to the T2MAIN
         program.
     8.  19-May-1987 - Virtual memory added to VAX version.
     9.  5-Jun-1987  - Fixed hidden line algorithm.  It used wrong average
         X,Y to calculate the vertical.  As a result it treated as  hidden
         many lines incorrectly.
    10.  11-Jun-1987  - Fixed infinite loop in T2MSFV.  Rewrote T2MESH for
         better hidden line removal.  The old  algorithm  would  leave  in
         hidden  lines, or omit visible line segments that are bisected by
         sharp peaks.  The new algorith fixes these errors with less  than
         a 5% loss in cpu speed.
    11.  17-Jun-1987  -  Fixed problems with title overflow for small page
         sizes.  Added LINES parameter to  SET  TITLE  and  SHIFT  to  SET
         LABELS.   Added  numbered  windows.   Negative  SCRD will produce
         constant view of mesh.  Dot plots and mesh plots  were  optimized
         for  max  speed.   Essentially  the  user can select windows more
         easily.
    12.  23-Jun-1987  - Fixed problems with 3-d text.  The DUPLEX font did
         not work for 3-d text, it  caused  array  overflows  or  spurious
         lines.   3-d  text processing was somewhat optimized.  The syntax
         of the SET GRID  command  has  been  brought  in  line  with  set
         AXES,LABEL,TITLE commands.
    13.  16-Jul-1987 - Fixed SET THREE to conform to documentation.
    14.  23-Jul-1987 - Modified T2TLAB so that labels may be generated for
         data with a large range.  Some changes were also made in  T2CNTR.
         Added  Table  generation  for  1/2-d  data.  Limit generation was
         modified to keep the limits within reasonable  values,  when  the
         data  has  very  small  relative variation.  Title generation was
         modified to keep long titles on the screen.  The  character  size
         is  reduced  by  up  to a factor of 4 if the title is too long to
         fit.
    15.  30-Jul-1987  -  Modified YEAR/MONTH scale so that all days occupy
         equal space.
    16.  30-Aug-1987
         A.  Lexicals  were  added  as  input  to allow access to internal
             numbers.
         B.  The  SET STATISTICS command allows the user to set the actual
             statistical data used by the lexicals.
         C.  SET DIGITS  determines  the number of digits used for output.
             DIGITS options in  titles  allow  formatting  of  numbers  in
             titles.
         D.  PLOT TABLE - plots the data as a table of numbers.
         E.  PLOT AXES/GRID - Has options X,Y,Z...  to allow absolute user
             control over axes/grid generation.
         F.  INHIBIT  option has been added to SET LABELS, SET AXES...  To
             allow inhibiting axes generation while  still  leaveing  room
             for the axes.
    17.  16-Sep-1987 - Added mesh data handling to X,Y,Z commands, as well
         as MINUS and DIVIDE options.  MULTIPLY and DIVIDE commands may be
         used  to  manipulate  histograms  or spectra.  The X,Y,Z commands
         were modified to handle DX,DY, and DZ automatically.
    18.  14-Oct-1987  -  Added Lexicals for external histogram parameters.
         Modified PLOT command so that the current texture applies to  the
         error  bars.  DEFINE VALUE and DEFINE STRING commands were added.
         S_ lexicals were added for access to string lexicals.
    19.  31-Oct-1987 - Added LOG option to BIN, SWAP, X, SMOOTH, SET HIST,
         DEFINE  HIST,  ADD,  MULTIPLY,  and   DIVIDE   commands.    Added
<A NAME="241">         SET MODE LOG  for automatic logging.  Added SET WINDOW LEVEL=n to </A>
         make inset windows easier.  Added INSIDE option to SET LABELS  to
         make packed windows easy to create.
