<B><H4>15.64.18.20  String</H4></B>  - This is passed to UGOPEN.  This selects options for
the selected device.  The options  are  separated  by  commas.   For  more
information see:UGSYS.  An example of using the string is:
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>DEVICE</U> <U>SIXELS</U> <U>"LN03HI,NOCLEAR,NORESET,LENGTH=n,inches"</U>

This  selects  output  for  the  LN-03 with no imbedded formfeeds or reset
commands.  You might produce a plot in this form so you can add it  to  an
existing text file.  The result is a plot imbedded in the text.

LENGTH=n  adjusts  the  page  length where n is the length of the paper in
inches.  Shortening the plot size is useful for imbedded plots.   You  may
also lengthen the page length on the LA50 and LA100 printers.

If the option inches is omitted the length is in centimeters.
