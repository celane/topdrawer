Puts Axes and grid on the plot, but does not plot points.  This command is
not usually necessary as axes are added to  the  picture  when  the  first
PLOT,  HISTOGRAM,  or  JOIN  command is executed.  If you use this command
before a PLOT, HISTOGRAM or JOIN command, then the automatic axes are  not
produced.   The limits of the axes are determined either from the existing
data or from the the SET LIMITS command, or by the LIMITED  options.   The
<A NAME="104">format  of  the axes is determined by the SET AXES command.  The origin of </A>
the axes may be specified after the option AT.

     This command is mainly useful for special graphs where 2 sets of axes
with different scales are needed.  This is also used to plot axes on  a  3
dimensional plot where x,y,z specify the origin of the axes.  3-d plots do
not automatically produce axes, so you must use the PLOT AXES command.

     The  origin  may  also be specified by the command SET THREE.  If not
already specified by SET AXES,  LABELS,  or  TICKS  commands,  the  color,
texture, and intensity options will be used in plotting the axes.
