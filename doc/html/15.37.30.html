<B><H4>15.37.30  Yerrors</H4></B>     

The  error bars on the Y values are used as weighting factors for the fit.
If they are all 0.0 they are assumed to be 1.0.   The  resulting  fit  has
error  bars on the coefficients according to the assumed error bars on the
Y values.  X errors are not used in the fit.

When  a curve is generated, it will have error bars on the Y values if the
fitted curve had non zero error bars.  For some functions the final errors
depend  on the initial center of the expansion.  This is set by specifying
an offset (OFFSET=n).  Generally best results are obtained with an  offset
in the middle of the data set.
