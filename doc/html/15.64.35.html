Limits define the space to draw the data.  They do not necessarily limit
the data points plotted.  Normally limits are automatically set from all
available data during the first plot.  If you read data, plot and then
read more data and plot again, the first data set determines the limits.
This command allows you to set the limits of the plot independently of the
data.  This should be used before the first PLOT, JOIN, HIST, or BARGRAPH
command.  The limits are reset when a new plot is started.  If this
command is issued without any limits specified, all currently set limits
are removed.
                                  <U>WARNING</U>
     If this command is issued in between 2 plots overlaying each
<A NAME="156">     other, they will not have the same scales. </A>
