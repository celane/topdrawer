TIME = CPULIM(OTIME)

     This  call  will  give  you  the  difference  in  cputime between the
remaining cpu time and the previous time (OTIME) in seconds.  If otime=0.0
then the total time limit since the start of your process is returned.  If
CPULIM(0.0) is zero then there is no time limit on your process.

                                  Example
     TIME=CPULIM(CPUTIM(0.0))
This gives you the time remaining.  If this is negative, then there was no
limit.

This subroutine is independent from the rest of TOPDRAWER
