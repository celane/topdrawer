     <U>ST</U>OP|<U>END</U>|<U>EX</U>IT|<U>HA</U>LT|<U>QU</U>IT ['string'] These commands all stop TOPDRAWER.
Any data remaining in the buffers is flushed, and  all  output  files  are
closed.
This is also equivalent to typing Ctrl_Z if Ctrl_Z is ON.

The  program  is  stopped and the string is typed.  If you wish to stop in
the middle type Ctrl_C.  This will abort the current operation and restore
the  prompt.   If  you  are in the middle of getting data from a file, the
file will skip to the next CLEAR or STOP command.  Pressing  Ctrl_C  twice
rapidly in succession will abort all file input.  If you type Ctrl_C twice
rapidly again you will be prompted if you wish to  terminate  the  program
completely.
