<B><H4>15.64.18.16.4  Options</H4></B>  - 
     1.  "HARDST"  or "SOFTST" select hardware structure, or software line
         structure.  HARDST is faster,  but  SOFTST  will  give  identical
         results on all devices.
     2.  "HIRES"  or  "LORES" select the resolution (4096 or 1024).  HIRES
         is slower, and will only work on some devices.  For example HIRES
         messes up the plots on a Visual-102.
     3.  "HARDCH"  or  "SOFTCH" selects the range of character generation.
         HARDCH generates 4 character sizes by hardware.  SOFTCH generates
         only 1.
     4.  "NOINTEN"  or  "INTEN"  selects  intensity  variation.  This only
         works on "real" 4010 terminals, and VT-240.   There  are  only  2
         levels of variation 1,2,3 or 4,5.
     5.  "HEIGHT=n" selects the screen height in cm.  This componsates for
         emulators without "good" aspect ratios.
     6.  "YPIXELS=n"  selects  the number of Y pixels for emulators with a
         different number from the standard 3120.   This  may  be  in  the
         range of 1024 to 4096.  Xpixels are assumed to be 4096.
     7.  "WIDTH=n" selects the screen width in cm.
     8.  "SLOW" selects full rather than compressed output for each point.
         All redundant characters are transmitted.
     9.  "RECSIZE=nnn" selects the record size (72-512)
    10.  "RSEGM"  or  "NSEGM" - Selecte [no]return to terminal mode at end
         of each segment.  This  is  useful  for  terminals  that  support
         simultaneous ANSI, and Tek graphics on screen at the same time.
    11.  "COLOR=WRGBYMCB"  -  specifies the 8 color mapping characters for
         White, Red, Green, Blue,  Yellow,  Magenta,  Cyan,  Black.   Each
         escape  sequence  has  a unique single character to select color,
         which may be specified by the color option.  Spaces indicate keep
         the color the same.  For example KERMIT uses "COLOR=71243560"
    12.  "PRECOL=sequence"  specifies  the "escape" sequence to use before
         the color character.  For example KERMIT uses "PRECOL=[3"
    13.  "POSTCOL=sequence"  specifies the sequence to use after the color
         character.  For example KERMIT uses "POSTCOL=m"
    14.  "ENTER=sequence"   specifies   the  "escape"  sequence  to  enter
         TEK-4010 mode from terminal mode.  For example VT-240 and  KERMIT
         use "ENTER='[?38h'"
    15.  "EXIT=sequence"  specifies the "escape" sequence to Exit TEK-4010
         mode to terminal mode.  This sequence is  executed  whenever  the
         screen  is  erased  or  at  the  end  of each segment if RSEGM is
         selected.  For example VT-240 and KERMIT use "EXIT='[?38l'"

NOTE:   It  is  assumed  that the escape character "27" begins each escape
<A NAME="137">sequence, and  it  need  not  be  entered.   Escape  sequences  containing </A>
lowercase  letters need to be inside quotes.  In addition escape sequences
are limited to 7 characters and they may not contain blanks.
