A  fit  may  fail with floating point overflow when the number of terms is
large.  Sometimes you may avoid this be rescaling the data  to  a  smaller
range,  and fitting the rescaled data.  Selecting an offset for X may also
prevent errors.

For example you have data with X ranging from 1 to 100 and Y from 0 to 10.
When you try to fit the data with more  than  9  terms  you  get  floating
overflow.   This may be prevented by rescaling X to be in the range .01 to
1.
     TD:<U>X=X</U> <U>TIMES</U> <U>0.01</U>
Then try performing the fit again.

Even  if  there  is no overflow, a fit may fail if a large number of terms
are selected, and the limit  of  the  computer  accuracy  is  reached  (14
digits).   Polynomials are particularly sensative to this type of problem.
In general polynomials should not be fitted to more than 9 terms.
