<B><H4>15.64.18.16.9  Hints</H4></B>  - Some terminals such as the KERMIT emulation do not
support simultaneous display of graphics and text.  This may be  fixed  in
several  ways.   You  can specify the "RSEGM" option, and do a SHOW CURSOR
whenever you wish to look at the graphics page.

     Some  terminals such as the CIT328 , and the VT-240 clear the display
when switching from graphics  to  text.   For  such  devices  the  "NSEGM"
options  should be specified.  This returns to terminal mode only when the
device is closed, or when the screen is erased.

     You may modify the actual color mapping by specifying the appropriate
escape sequences.  For example for KERMIT you may  draw  black  against  a
white backround by specifying:
     SET DEVICE TEKTR "KERMIT,COLOR=01243567,POSTCOL=';7m'"
You  may  modify  the  color  mapping for TEK4027 to substitute Violet for
blue.
     SET DEVICE "COLOR=' &lt;'
