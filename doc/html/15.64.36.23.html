<B><H4>15.64.36.23  VECTOR</H4></B>  - VECTOR=ON requires software drawn characters
instead of hardware chars.  Character generation is slower, but more
uniform.  Software characters are always drawn when a non blank case
string is supplied, or if your output device can not produce hardware
characters in the size selected.  You may request hardware characters by
setting the title/label size to a negative value.  For compatability with
previous versions NOVECTOR is a synonym for VECTOR=OFF.
