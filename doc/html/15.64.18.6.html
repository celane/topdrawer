<B><H4>15.64.18.6  EXCL</H4></B>   - This  if  for  laser  printers using Talaris extended
control language (EXCL).  This includes  the  Talaris  1590  printstation.
This  device  is  capable of intensity (line width) variation, and erasing
data.  The line width is the intensity/150 inches.   It  produces  a  plot
11.0 by 8.5 inches in size with 0.25 inch margins.

The  advantage of this driver over TEK4010 on the Talaris is the number of
line  widths,  and  the  correct  reproduction  of  scatter  plots.    The
disadvantage  is  that  the  file size is larger, and you can not send the
file to a TEK-4010 emulator, to see the contents.
                                  Warning
Previously  it  was  stated  that  this  will  work  on  LN-03+.  Due to a
misunderstanding this is not true.   For  LN-03  printers  use  SIXELS  or
TEK-4010 for LN-03+.
