<B><H4>15.64.18.3  LANDSCAPE-PORTRAIT</H4></B>  - 
LANDSCAPE or PORTRAIT select the orientation of the plot on paper, for GKS
printer  drivers.   This  applies  to  Gpostscript,  EPS,  QMS1200,  EXCL,
Versatek,  IMAGEN  and  all DEC-GKS drivers that support page orientation.
This applies only to the  selected  driver,  and  not  to  any  additional
drivers selected, unlike the SIDEWAYS and ORIENTATION commands.

It does not apply to workstation windows or TEKtronix graphics.  To rotate
them use the SIDEWAYS or ORIENTATION option.

It  will  be  applied  in  addition  to the ORIENTATION option.  The final
rotation will be the sum of the 2 rotations applied.

(Default:LANDSCAPE)
