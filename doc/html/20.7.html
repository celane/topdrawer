     1.  Jan-1991  -  Added  documentation to command SET DEVICE on how to
         create separate plot and command windows for TEK-4010  and  REGIS
         graphics.
         Added procedures:  FREEZE.TOP and FREEZE22.TOP to TOPDRAWER_DIR:
     2.  18-Jan-1991  -  Fixed bug in module TXLINE that produced spurious
         lines by incorrect scissoring.
     3.  Added SET CYCLE, SHOW CYCLE commands and CYCLE option to CONTOUR.
     4.  21-Jan-1991  - Fixed bug in PLOT,JOIN,HISTOGRAM commands.  SLICES
         did not work properly when THREE was OFF.  Revision level 3.6.

         Added  options OFFSET,DATA,ABSOLUTE,VALUE,CURSOR to PLOT TABLE to
         move the table to more convenient locations.

         Add  option VECTOR to PLOT command, to plot a vector field, where
         DX,DY,DZ is the length of the vector.
     5.  29-Jan-1991 - Fixed security hole to conceal passwords when using
         files    over    DECnet.     Fixed    some    minor    bugs    in
         ADD/SUBTRACT/MULTIPLY commands.

         Add   option  VECTOR  to  ADD/SUBTRACT/MULTIPLY  commands  to  do
         operations on VECTOR fields.
     6.  8-Feb-1991  -  Added  SET  MODE CHECK,CONFIRM,TREE.  These select
         whether checking,  confirmation,  or  HBOOK  tree  searching  are
         defaulted   to   ON.    Added   options   POINTS,ROWS,LIMITED  to
         ADD/SUB/MULT/DIV commands This  allows  compete  selection  of  a
         subset  of data to operate on.  Added option CHECK to FFT command
         to allow turning off data checking.
     7.  11-Feb-1991  -  Fixed  problem with short ticks being produced in
         SET SCALE when option LABEL=n preceded TICKS=m.  Version 3.7
     8.  28-Feb-1991  - Added options FILL,HIDE to most commands that draw
         something.  This means  you  may  fill  and  hide  BOXES,CIRCLES,
         DIAMONDS,  HISTOGRAMS,  ARROWS.   In  addition  the SET/SHOW FILL
         commands allow you to manipulate the fill  patterns.   Added  the
         command  SET/SHOW  SHIELD  to  shield  a  section  of a plot from
         further plotting.  Added  A  GKS  (DEC)  for  those  devices  not
         availble  through  UGS.   Fixed  a  minor  bug that switched line
         texture unexpectedly in UIS driver.
     9.  4-Mar-1991 - Added SET/SHOW UNITS to allow you to reset both TEXT
         and character units.

         Fixed some problems with 3d histograms.  Conditionalized the code
<A NAME="244">         means that the defaults are all in CM instead of INCHES.  You may </A>
         use these conditionals to build a completely metric  verstion  of
         TD.
    10.  15-Mar-1991   -   Version   4.0   Added   options  SELECT="name",
         NAME="name" to add names to data sets.  SELECT selects data  sets
         by  name,  while  NAME  sets  the data set name.  HBOOK histogram
         names are automatically propagated to the data set.  Option TITLE
         added  to JOIN, PLOT, HIST, CONTOUR to add title when data set is
         plotted.
    11.  25-Mar-1991  -  Added  NONLINEAR  option  to FIT to use MINUIT to
         perform fits on nonlinear functions.  Fixed problem in  arbitrary
         linear fit functions.
         Version 4.0.
    12.  2-May-1991  -  Updated  HBSEARCHID  and T2SETH4 to be HBOOK V4.10
         compatible.  Added more units to SET UNITS.
    13.  14-Jun-1991  - Add options WIDTH, HEIGHT to SET DEVICE.  Made the
         default the new version of TOPDRAWER.  Fixed some bugs  with  SET
         UNITS.
    14.  28-Jun-1991 - Modified the X,Y,Z commands so that DX,DY or DZ are
         automatically recomputed when an expression is used.
    15.  22-Jul-1991  -  Fixed  a  bug  in  STORE HIST command.  The wrong
         default RECL was used.  Removed calls to obsolete HFNEXT routine.
    16.  23-Aug-1991  -  Added  option  MESH to FIT command for MESH fits.
         Added option APPEND to LIST command  to  append  listing  on  old
         file.   Fixed error handling for MINUIT fits.  Now the errors are
         the same for linear and NONLINEAR fits.  Added  functiond  DGAUSS
         and DPOLY to list of functions, as fits of Z vs X,Y.  Fixed a bug
         in T2MESH that messed up histograms of  mesh  data  with  errors.
         GMINUT has been added to NTOPDRAWER.
    17.  Sept-1991  -  Added  option  SAVE  to CONTOUR to save the contour
         lines in data sets.  Fixed an 2 outrageous bugs in  T2SMOOTH  and
         SMCTRL.   One  bug incorrectly treated the end points of a curve.
         The other would delete isolated data points that were adjacent to
         a flat region in the data.

         Added INTERPOLATE command to produce interpolated data sets using
         local fitting procedures.  This uses the same procedures  as  the
         JOIN  command.  Added MONITOR option to BIN, FIT, FFT, CONVOLUTE,
         SMOOTH commands to plot before/after pictures.   Added  SET  MODE
         MONITOR/APPEND to enable automatic MONITOR, APPEND.

         Fixed  equations  inside  FIT command.  Arbitrary equations would
         sometimes give incorrect results.  It has been fixed.
         Version 4.31
    18.  Nov-1991  -  Fixed  fatal error in FIT that prevented producing a
         curve from set coefficients.  Fixed some  bugs  in  all  commands
         that use the option CHECK.
    19.  Version 4.4 Added ORIENTATION=n to SET SIZE/DEVICE commands.
    20.  Apr-1992  Added  option  PORTRAIT/LANDSCAPE  to set device.  Also
         added device EPS.
    21.  July-1992
         A.  Fixed the BIN command to work properly with data when DY=0.
         B.  Added  options  BREAK/SUPPRESS  to  SET BAR to suppress error
             bars around the symbol for a PLOT command.
         C.  Added  some  fixes  to  SET  DEVICE for DECGKS-3D to send the
             Xwindow output to the correct device.  Added some FNAL fixes,
             and added output options to initial command line.
                  $ TOPDRAWER [filename [device1 [device2 ...]]]
<A NAME="245">         D.  Added new coordinates NDX,NDY,NDZ to PLOT/BAR/HIST assymetric </A>
             error  bars.   These  are  NOT  used  in  some   computations
             involving errors.
         E.  Fixed  an  error  in  TOKEN that prevented access to the data
             point lexicals when the data  set  number  (3'rd  index)  was
             specified.
         F.  Fixed an error that produced spaces when more than 195 points
             are joined.
         G.  Reversed  the  default  for  ERROR  option on the SWAP,SMOOTH
             command.  Now the ERROR option should be default  be  on  for
             all commands.  By setting the REVISION to lower than 5.0 this
             should revert to the old behavior.
         H.  Added  the  minus (-) sign as a continuation character at the
             end of a line.
         I.  Added options SET AXES FRONT,BOTH,THREE
             To  allow  default  plotting  of  3-d  axes  in  a "sensible"
             fashion.
         J.  Added options SET GRID OUTLINE,Z
             To improve the 3-d grid capability.
         Version 5.0
    22.  Aug-1992 V5.1 - Fixed some bugs in the PLOT command.
         NOSYMBOL did not work
         POINTS FROM n TO m would not select the correct range of points.
