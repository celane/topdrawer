<B><H4>15.64.65.3.1  Example</H4></B>  - 
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>WINDOW</U> <U>Y</U> <U>1.2</U> <U>OF</U> <U>2.5</U>
Divides  y  into 2.5 windows and sets the current window to 1.2.  Assuming
the y size is the default 10 inches, the total window runs from 0.8 inches
to  4.8  inches.   Since the window is positive, the actual window area is
reduced  to  make  room  for  labels.   The  actual  plot  area  would  be
approximately 1.6 inches to 4.3 inches.
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>WINDOW</U> <U>Y</U> <U>1.2</U> <U>OF</U> <U>-2.5</U>
Divides  y  in  the  same  fashion as above, except that the actual window
occupies the entire specified area from y=0.8 inches to y=4.8 inches.   If
a second window is then specified:
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>WINDOW</U> <U>Y=2.2</U>
it  is adjacent to the first one, with the top axes of the first window in
the same location as the bottom axes of the second window.
