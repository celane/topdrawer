Normally  for  2-d  plots  X  is  the  independent  variable  and Y is the
dependent one.

Normally  for  3-d  plots  X,Y  are the independent variables and Z is the
dependent variable.

The  bin width is half way between the X or X,Y values if DX,DY are 0.  If
DX,DY are specified then they determine the bin width.
