          [SLICES [X|Y|Z] [<U>FR</U>OM] v1 [[<U>TO</U>] v2]] [CYCLE[=ON|OFF]]
               or...
          [SLICE X|Y|Z=v1] [CYCLE[=ON|OFF]]

This plots a histogram sliced from mesh data.  This command is illegal for
normal data.  If v2 is omitted then v2=v1.  If a range  is  selected  then
all  slices  within the range are histogrammed.  IF you set THREE=OFF then
the slices are histogrammed according to the first X,Y,Z Mentioned.  If  X
is  first then the slices are taken perpendicular to the X axis.  You only
need select X|Y|Z the first time you slice after a NEW FRAME command.
