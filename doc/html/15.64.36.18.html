<B><H4>15.64.36.18  QUICK</H4></B>  - This turns off certain calculations to make plotting
faster.  One side effect of this is to prevent proper centering or
justification of titles, and labels.  If you wish both speed and proper
justification, you can get proper justification for titles with no
sub/superscripts by:
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>MODE</U> <U>PROPORTIONAL=OFF</U>
Plots can be made still faster by:
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>MODE</U> <U>VECTOR=OFF</U>
This only works if your output device has hardware character generation
for the size characters you select.
