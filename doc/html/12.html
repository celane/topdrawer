There  are  several  fonts  available  in the unified graphics.  They are:
EXTENDED and DUPLEX.

The  EXTENDED  and DUPLEX support many sets of characters.  The DUPLEX set
is slow compared to the extended set, but it  looks  almost  like  printed
characters  if  you use a high resolution device.  The alternate character
sets are determined by a character pair.  The first  character  determines
the actual character printer, the second one determines the case.
