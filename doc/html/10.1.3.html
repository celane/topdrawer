     1.  + - Add
     2.  - - Subtract
     3.  * - Multiply
     4.  / - Divide
     5.  ** - Power
These follow the same rules of precedence as in FORTRAN.  For example:
     1.  2*3/4 is the same as (2*3)/4 or 1.5
     2.  2*3+4*5 is the same as (2*3)+(4*5) or 26
     3.  2**2**3 is the same as 2**(2**3) or 256
     4.  2**2*3 is the same as (2**2)*3 or 12
     5.  -2**2 is the same as -(2**2) or -4
Missing  operators  in  the  middle  of  an  expression  are assumed to be
multiply "*".  &lt;2(3)&gt; is the same as &lt;2*(3)&gt;.
