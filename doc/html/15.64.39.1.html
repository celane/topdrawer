     1.  X,Y,Z - The data to plot
     2.  U,V,W - Auxiliary coordinate data
     3.  DX,DY,...DW  -  The error on the data as half width for the error
         bars.
     4.  NDX,NDY,...NDW  -  The  negative  half  of the error bar.  If not
         defined then it is the same as the error (DX...).
     5.  RX,RY,...NRX,...NDW - Errors given relative to the central value.
         (DX=RX*X)
     6.  RADIUS,DRADIUS,THETA,DTHETA  - Polar coordinates are also enabled
         for the current plot.
     7.  PHI,DPHI  -  Spherical  coordinates  are  enabled for the current
         plot.
     8.  RRADIUS,RTHETA,RPHI  -  Errors given relative to a central value.
         If PHI is used SPHERICAL is enabled, otherwise POLAR is enabled.
     9.  SYMBOL  - The symbol to plot.  This should not be the first item.
         If you need to have the symbol first, then you must use the  READ
         POINTS command, or omit the symbol for the first data point.
    10.  DUMMY  -  Specifies  this entry is a dummy and should be ignored.
         If n is specified then n entries are ignored.  Only  numbers  are
         ignored.
    11.  fctr - Is a scale factor to multiply the data by when it is read.
         (Default:1.0)
    12.  PACKED  -  Specifies  that  dats is in packed format with several
         points per line and no semicolons ";" between them.
    13.  PERMANENT - Specifies that this order is permanent until the next
         SET ORDER command.

(Default:X 1.0,Y 1.0,DX 1.0,DY 1.0,SYMBOL)

If  this  command  is  used  without any options other than PERMANENT, the
order is set to the default.  Numeric fields preceding the symbol  may  be
onitted.
