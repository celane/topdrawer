<B><H4>15.37.3  EQUATION</H4></B>    

     <U>LINEAR</U>  This  allows you to enter equations for each term of a series
to fit.  Each term is separated by a semicolon  ";".   The  zeroeth  order
term  is  always  assumed  to  be  a constant so only the first, second...
order   terms   are   entered.    For   example   you    wish    to    fit
Y=C0+C1*X**1.5+C2*EXP(X)
     TD:FIT EQUATION "XV**1.5;EXP(XV)"

If you have previously fit using an equation:
     TD:FIT EQUATION ""
Uses  the  same equation for a new fit.  All other fit options may be used
with EQUATION, but any options that modify the number of terms to fit must
appear  after  the  equation  definition.   The X offset is ignored by the
equation.

     <U>NONLINEAR</U> If you wish to perform a fit to an arbitrary function of X,
then you must enter the coefficients in the the equation  as  COE[n],  and
you   must   specify  the  NONLINEAR  option.   Remember  that  each  term
automatically has a coefficient, so you should  use  coefficients  in  the
equation that have not been already used.  For example you wish to fit the
equation:
     C0+C1*/(1+C2*(X-C3)**2)
Recalling that C0, and C1 will already be used you enter:
     TD:FIT EQUATION "1/(1+COE[2]*(XV-COE[3])**2)" NONLINEAR TERMS=3
You  may  also  need  to  specify  initial values for the coefficients and
inital errors for the first step.
    CONSTRAIN=OFF COEF n0,n1,n2,n3 ERROR n0,n1,n2,n3

Note:   The  constant  term  COE[0] is fit by default.  Likewise the C1 is
automatically included as the coefficient of the first term.  To  get  rid
of the constant term you use the option:  EXCLUDE 0
