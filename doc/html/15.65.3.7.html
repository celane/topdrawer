<B><H4>15.65.3.7  Statistics</H4></B>   - The  statistics on the data are typed at the end
of the data.  This includes the following:
     1.  Range of data for X and Y
     2.  Sum of all Y values and average Y value per point.
     3.  Error  in  the sum.  This is only produced if the Y values have a
         non zero DY.  To specify errors for existing data see the command
         X.
     4.  Mean X value, and standard deviation of the mean.
         Mean=SUM(X*Y)/SUM(Y)
         Std=SQRT(SUM((X-MEAN)*Y))/SUM(Y)
     5.  Error  on  the  mean  and  standard  deviation.   These  are only
         produced if either DX or DY are non zero for  the  data.   DY  is
         used  if  available  otherwise DX is used to calculate the error.
         If the number of data points with Y,DX,DY non zero is less than 3
         then DX is also used to calculate the error.
