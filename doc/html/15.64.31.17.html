<B><H4>15.64.31.17  SELECT</H4></B>   - NAME='hist_name'  Selects the histogram by name or
title.  The data in the histogram is loaded into  the  data  buffer.   The
entire list of histograms is searched starting at the first one for a name
matching the hist_name.  If a histogram has more characters  in  its  name
than the hist_name, the extra characters are ignored.  If the option NEXT,
PREVIOUS, FIRST, or LAST  is  used,  the  search  begins  from  the  NEXT,
PREVIOUS,  FIRST,  or  LAST  histogram.  Percent '%' and star '*' are wild
characters.  '%' means any single character while '*' means any  character
string.    For   example  NAME='*ENERGY'  will  select  a  histogram  name
containing the word ENERGY.  However NAME='ENERGY' will select a histogram
beginning   with   the  word  ENERGY.   NAME='*PI*ENERGY'  will  find  all
histograms with the name containing the string 'PI' followed by  the  word
ENERGY  separated  by any number of characters.  The case of the hist_name
is ignored.

If  more  than  1  histogram match the selected name, a warning message is
issued.
