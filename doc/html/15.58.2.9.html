<B><H4>15.58.2.9  FORMATS...</H4></B>    - These  determine  the  number format.  They are
analogous to FORTRAN formats.
     1.  FFORMAT  -  Numbers  are  written  as  nn.nnn or nn The number of
         digits to the right or left of the decimal point is determined by
         the  data.   All  labels for a selected axis are written with the
         same number of digits to the right of the decimal point.
     2.  GFORMAT  -  Numbers are written as either F or E format depending
         on the range.  For example if you specify labels from 0 to  1  by
         .25 they are written as.  0,0.25,0.5,1
     3.  EFORMAT  -  Labels  are written as n.nn with an exponent power of
         10.
     4.  YEARS - Only the year is written
     5.  MONTHS - The month is written
     6.  DAYS - The day of the month is written
     7.  TIME - The time is written.
     8.  DATE - The date is written in the format dd-mmm-yyyy.
(Default:GFORMAT)

                                   NOTE
If  the  format  is  not  G,F,or E then SMALL ticks are not reproduced for
labels.  This allows you to place the label in any  location  without  any
ticks.
