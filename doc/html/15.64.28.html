This selects which fonts are used in generating plots.
<U>SE</U>T <U>FON</U>T [<U>BA</U>SIC|<U>EX</U>TENDED|<U>DU</U>PLEX]
<A NAME="145">     1.  BASIC - 64 character uppercase font (not useful) </A>
     2.  EXTENDED - Full font with Greek and lowercase (Default)
     3.  DUPLEX  - Fancy font.  This one may not look good on devices such
         as Tektronix 4010 with limited resolution.   This  also  requires
         the most memory and time to generate.

This  option  remains  in effect until changed by a SET FONT command.  The
EXTENDED and DUPLEX fonts both use proportional spacing.  If you  wish  to
use a fixed spacing font See:Command SET MODE PROPORTIONAL.
