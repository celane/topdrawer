     1.  NUMBER selects the number of entries up to a maximum of 20
         (Default:5)
     2.  ENTRY  selects  the  cycle  entry to change.  If n is omitted the
         next entry is selected.   If  no  entry  is  specified  then  all
         entries  are  set.   ENTRY  must  follow  the options you wish to
         change.
     3.  PERMANENT saves the current settings as the default.
     4.  SYMBOL selects the symbol to use.
Once  you  select a color, texture, symbol, or width they remain in effect
until changed, or the next NEW command.  If no options are  selected,  the
entries all revert back to the default values.
