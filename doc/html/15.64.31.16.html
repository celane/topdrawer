<B><H4>15.64.31.16  SECTION</H4></B>   - SECTION=SECTION_NAME  maps  a  global  section to
Topdrawer, for  getting  histograms.   If  IDENT  is  specified  then  the
selected histogram is fetched from the global section.  If the section has
a  blank  name  (SECTION="")  the  already   mapped   section   is   used.
