     1.  x,y,z  -  specify the location of the ends of the arrow.  If z is
         specified the end point  is  assumed  to  be  specified  in  data
         coordinates.   If CURSOR is specified you may enter the end point
         with the cross hair cursor.  The cursor appears  on  the  screen.

         press any other key, the end point is not entered.
     2.  DATA - specifies X,Y are in data coordinate frame.  Normally they
         are in the TEXT coordinate frame.
