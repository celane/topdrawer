<B><H4>15.64.31.3  AREA|DIRECTORY</H4></B>    - This   selects   the   histogram  AREA  or
DIRECTORY.  If you specify "//"  or  "/"  then  the  "root"  directory  or
"//PAWC"  is  selected.  If the area begins with "/" then it is considered
to be a subdirectory of the root.   ""  moves  down  the  directory  tree.
"AAAA"  move  up  the tree to subdirectory AAAA.  and "aAAA" moves over to
the adjacent subdirectory AAAA.  Note that "" may need to be  enclosed  in
quotes,  unless  you  have SET CHAR ALPHA "".  Unfortunately if you modify
the meaning of "" then dates must be entered  enclosed  in  angle  brakets
&lt;1989523&gt;.   This  is  generally not necessary unless you have directories
which consist entirely of numbers.

If  you use "wild" characters in an area name then a directory tree search
is automatically done using the wild characters to select  subdirectories.
Wild  characters  are  "*" which means and string, and "%" which means any
character.

                                  example
Assume you are in directory "//PAWC/X"
     TD:SET HIST AREA Y
moves you to //PAWC/X/Y
     TD:SET HIST AREA "q"
moves to //PAWC/X/Q
     TD:SET HIST AREA /A
moves to //PAWC/A
     TD:SET HIST AREA //
moves to //PAWC
     TD:SET HIST AREA /E* ID=2
Gets   the   first   histogram   with  ID=2  from  area  //PAWC/ENERGY  or
//PAWC/ERROR...
