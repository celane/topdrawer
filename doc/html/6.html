The device may be specified on the command line.  Otherwise  TD  sets  the
output  device  according  to  the  logical name PLOT_TERM or if it is not
defined PLOT_DEVICE.  If neither is defined the device is assumed to be  a
Talaris printer.

Normally  PLOT_TERM  is  automatically  set  when  you  log in.  It is not
defined for a batch job.  This means that TD uses your  terminal  when  in
interactive  mode,  and  the  Talaris  while in a batch stream.  The login
procedure defines PLOT_TERM by asking  the  terminal  for  its  ANSWERBACK
message.  This message must be set properly inside the terminal.  You need
to know how to SET-UP the ANSWERBACK message.
