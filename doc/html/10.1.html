     &lt;expressions&gt;
An  expression  is an arithmetic computation enclosed inside angle brakets
"&lt;&gt;".  An expression uses similar syntax to FORTRAN.  The syntax is not as
rigid as FORTRAN and some syntactical elements may be omitted.  Expression
evaluation is very slow, so you should use them sparingly.
