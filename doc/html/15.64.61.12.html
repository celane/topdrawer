<B><H4>15.64.61.12  ESCAPE</H4></B>   - This  defines  a  character  to use as an "escape"
character.  After the escape character you  enter  a  "text","case"  pair.
This  allows  you  to  imbed  text case pairs in the text, without using a
separate case line.  When used with the substitution you can define macros
for  expressions.   To output the ESCAPE character you must enter it twice
followed by a space.
                                 example
     TD:SET TITLE ESCAPE="@"
     TD:TITLE TOP "This is a Greek alpha @AG"
Writes a title with an imbedded alpha.
     TD:TITLE TOP "This an at symbol @@ ."
Writes the title:"This an at symbol @."
