<B><H4>15.64.59.8  PERMANENT</H4></B>   - This  makes  all  currently  set  parameters the
default.  Since the command line is parsed from left to right, options  on
the  left  side of this option are permanent, but options to the right are
not.  When a new plot  is  started  the  current  options  revert  to  the
permanent value.
