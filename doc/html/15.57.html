     {<U>PA</U>USE|<U>WA</U>IT} ['String'] [<U>FO</U>R n]

This  causes  TOPDRAWER  type  the string and PAUSE.  This only works in a
file or inside a repeat block.  You press the "Return"  key  to  continue.
If instead of "return" you type in STOP, TOPDRAWER will stop executing the
input file or repeat block and return to command level.  You can also type
EXIT,  QUIT,  HALT,  END, or Ctrl_Z instead of STOP.  You may also use SET
and SHOW commands while paused.
