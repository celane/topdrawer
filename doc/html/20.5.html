     1.  Jan-1989  -  Fixed  error calculations for fitting routines.  The
         quoted errors were too large.  Added ERROR option to FIT command.
         Fitted curves are generated with error bars now.  ADD FIT to data
         set  now  also  adds  the  fitted  errors  unless  ERROR=OFF   is
         specified.   Fixed equation evaluation.  Exponents were evaluated
         incorrectly ie.  &lt;1.0E-3&gt;--&gt;1000.  and &lt;1.0E+3&gt;--&gt;.001

<A NAME="242">     2.  Feb-1989  -  Added  file  spec/LIST=/COMMAND=/JOURNAL= options to </A>
         TOPDRAWER command line.
     3.  Mar-1989 - Added MERGE command to merge data sets.
     4.  Apr-1989  - Added mixed data sets.  Mesh + regular data may exist
         as separate data sets.  Added error display to JOIN  command  for
         mesh  data.   ADD/SUB/MUL/DIV  commands  now  may  add mesh data.
         Added errors to mesh data.  SHOW STAT now shows mean/std...   for
         mesh data.  New options:
              ERROR had been added to command READ MESH,JOIN,CREATE MESH.
              APPEND has been added to READ MESH,CREATE MESH
         Modified options:
              SETS,   POINTS|COLUMNS,   LINES|ROWS   are  now  independent
         options.
         SETS - Specifies the data set only.
         POINTS - Specifies the point/column number within the set.
         When the LIMITED option is used, the Z value is used to limit the
         data.
         Created NETWINDOW files to use TD over the DECnet.
     5.  June-1989  -  Added  TEK4207  support  to TEK driver.  Speeded up
         REGIS/TEK drivers.  Added VAXSTATION (UGUISD driver) support.
     6.  Nov-1989  -  Added support for NTUPLES to NTOPDAWER.  Removed the
         slash as a separator.  It may be put back by the command:
              SET CHARACTER SEPARATOR "/"
     7.  Dec-1989 - A number of enhancements have been made to NTOPDRAWER.
         Added the options TREE to SAVE/RESTORE/SET HISTOGRAM commands and
         added   support   for   "wild"   characters  for  histogram  area
         specification.   Added  the   MONITOR   HISTOGRAM,   and   DELETE
         HISTOGRAM.   Removed support for RICE histograms from NTOPDRAWER.
         Added support for a GLOBAL SECTION containing HBOOK4  histograms.
         NTOPDRAWER  is  now  capable  of  handling HBOOK4 histograms in a
         fairly simple fashion.

         Both NTOPDRAWER and TOPDRAWER have been enhanced as follows.  The
         driver for TEK4010 has been modified to allow you to specify  the
         necessary escape sequences for entering and exiting TEK-4010 mode
         as well as for reproducing  colors.   Support  for  the  LSI-7107
         color  terminal  has  been  added.  Support for postscript and am
         IMAGEN printer has been added.  The options SPACE has been  added
         in addition to DOTS,DASH...  for line structure.
