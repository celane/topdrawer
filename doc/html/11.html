There are 2 different sets of frames used in  creating  plots.   They  are
DATA  and TEXT frames.  TEXT is always specified in inches Unless modified
by either a SET SIZE or SET UNITS command.  The character and symbol sizes
and  are  all specified in tenths of inches.  Both of these may be changed
by the SET UNITS command.  The actual data is in the DATA frame, which  is
mapped  to  the  physical (TEXT) frame at the time of plotting.  The plots
are all scaled automatically, unless you use the  command  SET  LIMITS  to
specify  the  scale.   All commands which plot "things" work in either the
DATA or the TEXT frame.  You may select the frame with the option DATA  or
TEXT.   In  addition if 3d coordinates are used the frame is automatically
DATA.

     The  DATA  frame  is  not  mapped  to the TEXT frame until a plotting
command or a command which uses the data frame is used.  Plotting commands
are  JOIN,  HISTOGRAM,  PLOT and so on.  Commands which use the data frame
are ARROW DATA, BOX DATA, TITLE DATA and so  on.   If  you  wish  to  have
TOPDRAWER  automatically  set  the  data frame, you should supply the data
<U>before</U> any commands which reference the data frame.

Several commands modify the data frame, once it has been defined:
     SET WINDOW
     SET LIMITS
     SET THREE
     SET SIZE
     SET SCALE
These commands allow you to overlay different plots with different scales.
Just reading in new data does not change the current data frame.
