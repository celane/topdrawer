<B><H4>15.64.36.5  CHECK</H4></B>  - CHECK=OFF is equivalent to using the CHECK=OFF option
for commands such as ADD, SMOOTH, FFT, DEFINE HIST ....  It turns off the
checks for appropriate data.  Usually this means that the data must be a
histogram with equally spaced bins.  For commands that take 2 data sets
there is the requirement that the data sets must match.
