Sets parameters.
     CALL TDSET(OPTIONS)

OPTIONS is a literal, hollerith, or array containing the options.
     see:Subroutine STRING
This  routine  is  not recommended.  It is provided for compatability with
older versions of TOPDRAWER.  Use TDTEXT instead.
The  options  are  the  same  as for the SET command.  For convenience you
probably should use TDSETS which is Fortran 77 compatible.

                                  example
     CALL TDSET('SIZE 10 BY 8')
This sets the size of the plot.
     CALL TDSET('COLOR BLUE')
Now everything is plotted in blue.
          or....
     BYTE STRING(11)
     DATA STRING/'C','O','L','O','R',' ',
    1 'B','L','U','E',';'/
     CALL TDSET(STRING)
