<B><H4>15.64.35.2  CURSOR</H4></B>  - CURSOR puts a cursor on the screen.  Move the cursor
to the desired first limits.  Then hit the space bar.  Next move the
cursor to the desired second limits, and again hit the space bar.  A new
set of limits are now set for the next graph.  If you wish to set only the
X limit hit "X" instead of "space".  Likewise hit "Y" or "Z" if you wish
to set only Y or Z limits.  The new limits are entered into the journal
file.

If both X limits are the same, then they are ignored.  Likewise identical
Y or Z limits are ignored.  For 3-d data the limits are not changed.
Instead the parameters SCRD, THETA, PHI, and CENTER are adjusted.  The
CURSOR option should be the last option in the command line for 3-d plots.

For example the following command will set new limits, and replot the
current data:
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>LIM</U> <U>CUR;NEW;PLOT</U>
