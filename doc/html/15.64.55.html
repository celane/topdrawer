<B><H4>15.64.55  STORAGE</H4></B> 

This defines what is kept in storage.  SET ORDER automatically  calls  SET
STORAGE  if  room  for extra data is needed.  This option remains the same
until changed by a SET ORDER or SET STORAGE command.  The VAX uses virtual
memory, so the actual amount of storage is not not limited, but expands as
needed.  If you have a virtual memory allocation failure, you may  prevent
it  by preallocating the needed memory with the SIZE option.  If you still
get memory allocation failures, ask your system manager  to  increase  the
available virtual memory.

(Default:SYMBOL,X,Y,DX,DY)

ALL selects all coordinates.  If this command is used without any options,
the storage is reset to the default.   If  all  3  coordinates  X,Y,Z  are
included in storage, 3-d plots are turned on.

If  DX,  the  error  on X, is selected then X is also selected.  If NDX is
selected  then  both  DX  and  X  are  selected.   Likewise   DY,DZ,..DPHI
automatically select Y....PHI.  SYMBOL, X and Y are always included in the
storage.  All other variables must be declared.

The  NDX  is  the  negative half of the error bar while DX is the positive
half.  If NDX is not in stoage then DX specifies both  halves.   Similarly
NDY and NDZ are the negative halves of the Y,Z error bars.

If  THETA  is specified polar coordinates are enabled permanently.  If PHI
is specified spherical coordinates are enabled.

SIZE=n  allows  you to pick the number of words of storage to allocate for
the VAX.  This is not necessary, but  it  may  save  time  since  you  may
preallocate  the  storage  and avoid multiple automatic storage expansion.
Normally the amount of storage needed for  regular  data  is  about  n*d+4
where  n  is  the  number  of  points  and  d is the number of coordinates
available  in  storage  (SYMBOL,X,DX,Y,DY,....).   For  mesh  data  it  is
((n+1)*(m+1)+4)*d+4  where  n and m are the mesh dimensions and d is 1 for
regular mesh data or 2 for data with errors.  If you have a name  for  the
<A NAME="176">data set it takes up 1 storage location for every 4 characters. </A>

                                  Example
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>STORAGE</U> <U>X</U> <U>Y</U> <U>SYMBOL</U>
To see the current storage use the command:  SHOW STORAGE.
     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>STORAGE</U> <U>SIZE=&lt;4+101*201+20&gt;</U>
Preallocates storage for a 100 by 200 mesh with an 80 character name.
