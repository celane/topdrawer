     XAXIS|YAXIS|ZAXIS angle

These  options  are  used  to  control  how the ticks and labels are drawn
relative to the axes.  If the angle is not specified or it is greater than
360  degrees  the  axes  are  drawn  in  either the XY,YZ, or ZX plane for
maximum visibility.  The angle allows you to rotate the labels,ticks,  and
title  around  the  axis.  The rotation is specified by permuting the axes
XYZ.  For a given axis n the angle 0 lies in the n,n+1 plane, and angle 90
lies in the n,n+2 plane, with the labels in the negative side.

                               Table of axes

This  gives the plane and direction of the labels.  The sign indicates the
side the labels are drawn on.

     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>THREE</U> <U>XAXIS=0</U>
This  draws  the X labels and ticks in the XY plane with the labels in the
negative X side of the axis.

     TD:<U>SET</U> <U>THREE</U> <U>YAXIS=90</U>
This  draws  the X labels and ticks in the YZ plane with the labels in the
negative Z side of the axis.
